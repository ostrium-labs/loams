# Loams WAL vs safekeepers: the P4b benchmark

The harness behind the merge gate in [§28 §7](../../docs/design/28-loams-postgres.md). It runs
pgbench through a Neon compute whose WAL goes either to **stock safekeepers** (the baseline)
or to **Loams’ WAL service on TiKV** (the candidate), on the same host and topology. The Loams
WAL replaces the safekeepers only if, for every workload:

- its p99 commit latency is at or below the safekeepers' (within the baseline's run-to-run
  noise), and
- its throughput is no worse.

Derived from [`deploy/neon`](../neon) (Apache-2.0, from `neondatabase/neon` `docker-compose/`).

## Topology

| Tier | Baseline (`--variant safekeepers`) | Candidate (`--variant loams`) |
|---|---|---|
| Compute | `compute-node-v16`, `shared_buffers = 2GB`, one per run on a fresh timeline | same |
| WAL | `safekeeper1` (`--replicas 1`) or `safekeeper1..3` (`--replicas 3`), fsync on, each on its own volume | `loams-wal-interpreted --store tikv` + a TiKV playground with 1 or 3 stores ([`tikv.toml`](tikv.toml)) |
| Pageserver feed | the safekeepers | `loams-wal` itself: the pageserver finds it through the storage broker and reads the interpreted protocol from it, in process (PG2 Tasks 31 and 32) |
| Storage | pageserver, storage broker, RustFS | same |
| Client | pgbench inside the compute container | same |

`loams-wal` refuses to listen beyond loopback unless it has `--auth-token` and `--trusted-network`
(it has no TLS yet, so the token is cleartext; the benchmark uses
loopback only). Everything uses host networking, so the compute reaches containers and host processes the
same way.

Until PG2 Task 31, a **feeder** (a `--no-sync` stock safekeeper that `loams-wal` streamed
committed WAL to) stood in for the interpreted sender, and the results up to 2026-10-01 include it
(`feeder_cpu_s` in their JSON). It is gone: no stock safekeeper runs in the candidate.
`scripts/pg2/it-pageserver-loams-wal.sh` checks that path end to end.

## Run

Build `loams-wal` once, with podman's socket (or Docker) and tiup available (see
[`scripts/tikv`](../../scripts/tikv)):

```sh
# loams-wal with the interpreted sender: its own workspace, with Postgres headers
scripts/pg2/pg-headers.sh ghcr.io/neondatabase/neon@sha256:ead56a7b33925ca4df9f1ee0d29f55fa25e165a3fee6a4f19055050c68e8cad0 \
  crates/loams-wal-decoder/pg_install
(cd crates/loams-wal-decoder && POSTGRES_INSTALL_DIR=$PWD/pg_install \
  cargo build --release --features tikv,nvme --bin loams-wal-interpreted)
# One run of one variant: writes bench/results/<date>-<sha>-<variant>-rf<n>-<label>.json
scripts/loams-pg-bench/run.sh --variant safekeepers --replicas 3
scripts/loams-pg-bench/run.sh --variant loams --replicas 3
# The gate: baseline and candidate interleaved three times, then the comparison.
scripts/loams-pg-bench/gate.sh --replicas 3 --repeats 3 --duration 300 --warmup 60 \
  --scale 50 --workloads "commit-1 commit-16 tpcb-16 tpcb-64 bulk bulk-burst"
```

`run.sh` waits while `cargo` or `rustc` runs on the host (pass `--force` to skip this), because
a build ruins p99s. The manual workflow [`loams-pg-bench.yml`](../../.github/workflows/loams-pg-bench.yml)
runs the gate on a dedicated self-hosted runner. Shared CI runners are too noisy for p99s.

## Workloads

These are defined in [`scripts/loams-pg-bench/workload.sh`](../../scripts/loams-pg-bench/workload.sh).
Each one has a warm-up, then `pgbench -l` per-transaction logs. Percentiles come from those
logs, not from pgbench's averages.

| Name | What | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `commit-1` | One single-row `INSERT` per transaction, 1 client | The pure commit round trip |
| `commit-16` | The same, 16 clients | Group commit |
| `tpcb-16` / `tpcb-64` | Built-in TPC-B at `--scale` | A realistic OLTP mix; saturation |
| `bulk` | One transaction inserting about 1 GB | Sustained WAL throughput (MB/s); **gated** |
| `bulk-burst` | One transaction inserting about 250 MB | A burst the drive cache absorbs; reported, **not gated** |

`bulk` is a sustained 1 GB write because a 250 MB burst measures the drive's cache, not the WAL: on
the laptop the stock safekeepers reach 118 to 182 MB/s on 250 MB but 22 to 26 MB/s on 1 GB, on the
same disk. The gate verdict counts `bulk`; `bulk-burst` stays in the results as a reported number.

## Results

Each run writes one JSON file with:

- topology and versions;
- settings;
- per workload: TPS and p50, p90, p99, p99.9 and max.

`scripts/loams-pg-bench/compare.py --baseline … --candidate …` prints the gate table. The
single-host results in [`bench/results`](../../bench/results) are laptop data points, not the
gate. The gate needs server hardware:

- NVMe with power-loss protection;
- the three-AZ topology of §7, with `tc netem` delays or real zones.

## Arm A on a laptop (2026-09-30)

Arm A (§28 §7.2) has three front-end and I/O tiers. They are run with
`gate.sh --replicas 3 --repeats 3 --duration 60 --warmup 10 --scale 10 --candidates "nvme-pwritev2 nvme-uring nvme-sqpoll"`
(baseline and candidates interleaved; the raw files and the gate report are in
[`bench/results`](../../bench/results), `gate-rf3-20260930T174137Z.md`):

| Variant | What runs |
|---|---|
| `nvme-pwritev2` | tokio front end, `O_DIRECT` + `pwritev2(RWF_DSYNC)` from a thread pool (the fallback tier) |
| `nvme-uring` | compio shards, io_uring, `O_DIRECT` + `O_DSYNC` writes (FUA on this drive) |
| `nvme-sqpoll` | as `nvme-uring`, with SQPOLL |

Three acceptors per run, each with its own journal on btrfs, and three stock safekeepers as the
baseline. Mean of 3 runs each, p50 / p99 in ms:

| workload | safekeepers | tokio pwritev2 | compio | compio + SQPOLL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| commit-1 | 8.48 / 34.02 | 9.23 / 39.05 | 6.52 / 27.83 | 6.03 / 26.83 |
| commit-16 | 13.86 / 89.82 | 8.57 / 57.68 | 5.74 / 68.45 | 5.63 / 57.84 |
| tpcb-16 | 32.35 / 304.22 | 18.99 / 231.68 | 14.70 / 205.74 | 12.70 / 118.14 |
| bulk (WAL MB/s) | 117.6 | 10.8 | 12.3 | 14.3 |
| WAL CPU per commit-1 tx (µs) | 3702 | 1893 | 1373 | 25055 |

A second run, made later with `run.sh` waiting for every build on the host to finish (no `--force`;
`gate-rf3-20260930T185121Z.md`), gives the same picture. p50 / p99 ms:

| workload | safekeepers | tokio pwritev2 | compio | compio + SQPOLL |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| commit-1 | 5.27 / 32.62 | 7.40 / 38.98 | 4.33 / 40.97 | 4.01 / 29.93 |
| commit-16 | 10.91 / 52.06 | 7.22 / 49.26 | 4.27 / 29.55 | 4.16 / 28.17 |
| tpcb-16 | 21.46 / 207.22 | 12.73 / 113.23 | 9.62 / 98.46 | 9.95 / 112.41 |
| bulk (WAL MB/s) | 74.1 | 17.0 | 21.7 | 14.9 |

Here compio's `commit-1` p99 (41 ms) is above the baseline's worst repeat, although its p50 and TPS are
better: single-client tail latency on this drive is not separated from noise by three runs. The
other findings hold.

What this shows, and what it does not:

- The commit-latency gate holds for compio and compio + SQPOLL on all three latency workloads.
  The tokio `pwritev2` fallback fails `commit-1` on throughput, not latency: its mean p99 (39 ms)
  is inside the baseline's range (26 to 39 ms), but its mean of 88 TPS is below the baseline's
  slowest repeat (92), dragged down by one 64 TPS run. It passes `commit-16` and `tpcb-16`.
- **Before the journal fix, the gate as a whole failed, for every tier, on `bulk`.** One 250 MB transaction runs at
  11 to 14 MB/s on Arm A against 118 MB/s on the safekeepers. The same figure on all three tiers
  points at a cause above the I/O tier (how the journal seals units or how the acceptor batches
  appends under a streaming walproposer), not at the runtime. These are the results before the
  journal fix; [Why `bulk` was slow, and what changed](#why-bulk-was-slow-and-what-changed) below
  has the cause and the numbers after it.
- SQPOLL buys a little latency (p99 tpcb-16 118 ms against 206 ms) and costs 18 times the CPU per
  commit, because the poller thread spins. It is worth it only on a core that has nothing else to do.
- This is a laptop, so read the numbers as direction, not as the gate. The noise column of the gate
  report shows p99 spreads of 39% to 97% between baseline repeats, and most "pass" margins are
  inside it. The host was shared: other builds and CI jobs ran during the runs (`--force`), so
  p99 and p99.9 are pessimistic and unevenly so. The drive is a client NVMe (Samsung BM9C1a) with a
  volatile write cache, so a FUA write costs more than on a power-loss-protected drive; the
  journals and the baseline's volumes share one btrfs; all three acceptors and all three
  safekeepers share one disk; there is no injected cross-AZ delay. The gate itself needs the server
  hardware listed above, and an ext4 run to separate the btrfs cost.

### Why `bulk` was slow, and what changed

The `bulk` gap was not the runtime or the I/O tier. Measured on ext4 (no transparent compression)
with three acceptors on one client NVMe:

- Units were full (about 1.9 MiB), aligned and four in flight; WAL CPU was low. The journal was waiting
  on the device.
- Every stall coincided with a segment being prepared. Pre-zeroing a 64 MiB segment took 1.5 to 4.5 s
  under load, and journal writes ran 5 to 30 times slower meanwhile.
- The cause is the pre-zero itself. It doubles the bytes written, and it turns every later data write
  into an overwrite of already-written blocks. On this drive a `dsync` overwrite runs at about 70 MB/s,
  against 280 to 490 MB/s for a first write (`dd oflag=direct,dsync`, 1 GB of random data each way).
- Skipping pre-zeroing entirely fixes bulk (55 against 15 to 24 MB/s at 250 MB) but makes `commit-1`
  2.4 times slower (p50 2.9 against 1.2 ms), because each small write then converts an unwritten extent.

So the journal now pre-zeroes only when it is not busy: a segment that filled in under
`hot_segment` (2 s) means fast ingest, and new segments are prepared without pre-zeroing; the preparer
zeroes them later, once the journal goes quiet. `commit-1` is unchanged (p50 1.16 ms, p99 9.1 ms, against
1.17 and 8.6 before). A 1 GB `bulk` goes from 12 to 20 to 26 MB/s on three acceptors, which is where the
three stock safekeepers land on the same disk (22 to 26 MB/s). The 117.6 and 74.1 MB/s baseline figures above
for a 250 MB `bulk` are the drive absorbing a short burst, not sustained throughput.

## Not modelled yet

- **Cross-AZ delays.** Both variants run with zero injected delay.
- **The fault run.** This means killing a TiKV leader, or a safekeeper for the baseline, at
  minute 2.
- **TiKV leader placement.**

## P4b results, raw TiKV store (2026-10-01)

Three interleaved repeats per configuration (baseline, raw depth 1, 8, 32, then
the transactional store, in that order each round), on an exclusive host, for 1
and 3 TiKV stores (3 stores: leaders pinned to the compute's zone with
`place-leaders.sh`). 60 s per workload after 10 s warm-up, scale 10, compute
fsync off. Raw JSON is in `bench/results/2026-10-01-raw/`.

Each cell is p99 ms, median (min-max) over the 3 repeats, then median TPS.
The run-to-run spread is the noise estimate: for the baseline's commit-1 p99 it
is about 43% at rf1 and 23% at rf3; commit-16 54% at rf1, tpcb-16 22% at rf1 and 13% at rf3; at
rf3, a single baseline commit-16 run hit 398 ms. Differences
under those bands are not results.

| run (p99 ms median (min-max) / TPS) | safekeepers | Loams txn (rf3: leaders not placed, see below) | raw d1 | raw d8 | raw d32 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| rf1 commit-1 | 16.6 (16.5-23.6) / 197 | 45.6 (36.0-73.9) / 117 | 46.2 (24.1-48.9) / 138 | 44.0 (36.1-44.3) / 120 | 44.6 (40.3-45.1) / 133 |
| rf1 commit-16 | 31.2 (22.0-38.8) / 2129 | 69.7 (68.8-124.8) / 731 | 72.3 (44.9-75.0) / 919 | 40.7 (33.4-49.7) / 1361 | 57.6 (44.9-59.5) / 1388 |
| rf1 tpcb-16 | 116.0 (90.9-116.8) / 851 | 184.1 (175.6-337.5) / 465 | 193.8 (184.7-195.9) / 483 | 134.7 (122.5-144.5) / 543 | 128.3 (111.5-129.0) / 599 |
| rf1 bulk MB/s | 86.6 (45.2-101.2) | 20.7 (19.6-24.4) | 34.2 (27.4-68.7) | 49.6 (38.7-72.1) | 35.4 (34.0-35.6) |
| rf3 commit-1 | 39.7 (36.1-45.3) / 111 | 48.6 (48.3-64.8) / 76 | 54.6 (34.4-61.5) / 88 | 49.0 (48.1-66.5) / 71 | 47.4 (36.1-71.3) / 74 |
| rf3 commit-16 | 77.5 (65.5-398.0) / 767 | 74.2 (71.8-80.2) / 606 | 73.8 (56.1-77.0) / 746 | 77.9 (75.5-96.5) / 569 | 86.6 (77.7-102.5) / 592 |
| rf3 tpcb-16 | 213.7 (185.5-214.0) / 434 | 297.0 (292.8-358.6) / 263 | 243.3 (238.4-299.8) / 322 | 302.4 (223.2-313.3) / 291 | 271.2 (238.0-293.6) / 344 |
| rf3 bulk MB/s | 44.3 (32.8-57.0) | 9.3 (8.2-11.5) | 18.1 (9.0-18.1) | 11.4 (10.0-15.0) | 13.7 (10.0-14.8) |

Verdict: **the gate fails** in every configuration; Loams is behind the stock
safekeepers on commit-1 p99 by 2.7x at rf1 (44 vs 17 ms) and about 1.25x at rf3.
What the raw store and pipelining do buy, outside the noise at rf1: commit-16
p99 70 -> 41 ms and TPS 731 -> 1361 (txn -> raw d8), tpcb-16 TPS 465 -> 543-599,
bulk 21 -> 50 MB/s. At rf3 the raw store is within noise of the transactional
store on most rows (rf3 bulk and tpcb-16 improve, 9 -> 11-18 MB/s and 263 ->
291-344 TPS) and the 3-replica baseline is itself slow (p99 40 ms, noisy).
Depth 8 and 32 are indistinguishable (32 is not better). At rf1 depth 1 loses
the concurrent workloads; at rf3 depth 1 is not worse than 8 or 32 (within the
noise, and the replicated commit path is the bottleneck), so the default stays 8.

commit-1 and the Raft fsync: this host's NVMe (Samsung BM9C1a, no PLP) does an
8 KiB write + fdatasync in p50 2.65 ms, p90 9.9 ms, p99 48 ms, max 395 ms
(measured idle). commit-1 p50 is about 6 ms and its p99 about 44 ms, in line
with one fsync per commit plus the gRPC and Raft hops, so single-commit latency
is mostly bound by the fsync (and its tail), not by the extra read or TSO the
transactional store had (raw is no faster on commit-1). It is not purely the
fsync: the safekeepers fsync the same disk and keep a 17 ms p99, so TiKV's
extra work (raft-engine plus apply, region leader hop) roughly doubles the tail.
Only a PLP NVMe, or the local-NVMe WAL of Arm A, can remove that floor.

Correction found in review: `place-leaders.sh` only placed the raw key range
(`r`), so the transactional store's rf3 rows above ran with unplaced leaders.
After fixing it (one PD rule group per store mode) the transactional store was
rerun at rf3 with leaders placed, 3 interleaved repeats against fresh baselines
(`bench/results/2026-10-01-raw/txn-placed/`): baseline commit-1 p99 35.2 ms /
102 TPS, commit-16 65.7 / 1047, tpcb-16 268 / 312, bulk 78 MB/s; transactional
store with placed leaders commit-1 111.5 ms (92.5-118.5) / 30 TPS, commit-16
195.6 / 238, tpcb-16 874 / 116, bulk 9.3 MB/s. That is much worse than the
unplaced rows (48.6 ms / 76 TPS) and I do not know why (a raw-store control run
right after was normal: commit-1 p99 60 ms / 63 TPS, commit-16 86 ms / 622 TPS).
The transactional store is the superseded design, so it was not chased further;
the raw rows (placed) are unaffected.

Caveats: one laptop (14 CPUs, 16 GB, one shared consumer SSD), Neon and TiKV
and loams-wal all on it; n=3; the baseline's own spread is large; compute fsync
off; one TiKV store at rf1 (no replication).

Bug found by the gate: with a backlog (pgbench -i at depth 32) the feeder read
8 MiB scan pages, over tonic's 4 MiB decode limit, and reconnected forever, so
the compute stalled (the 25-minute hang). Fixed in #169, not a lost or unacked
pipelined append. `run.sh` now bounds each workload with a timeout.
