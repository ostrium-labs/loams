//! [`Subscriptions`], the subscription manager of one app on one node
//! (design §20 §8.2–§8.3; R1 plan Task 11).
//!
//! One task per app owns every subscription, the [`ReadSetIndex`] of their
//! read sets and a journal [`Tailer`]. It **ticks** on a TSO timestamp `T`:
//! right after a commit of the node's [`Runner`] (or [`Subscriptions::wake`]),
//! otherwise polling with backoff from `poll_min` to `poll_max`. A tick
//! reads the journal up to `T` (over several bounded batches when a backlog
//! is large; subscriptions are evaluated at `T` only after the batch that
//! reaches the heads visible at `T`), stabs every write's document key and
//! removed and added index keys into the index, **reruns** the invalidated
//! subscriptions at `T` (at most `rerun_concurrency` at once), replaces
//! their read sets and publishes one [`Tick`] with the results that
//! changed. Every subscription is then valid at `T` (§20 §8.3).
//!
//! - **Sharing.** Subscriptions with one [`SubKey`] (function and argument
//!   digest) share one entry and one rerun, with a reference count.
//! - **Coalescing.** A tick that would rerun waits until `min_rerun_interval`
//!   after the previous rerun, then reads at a fresh timestamp, so a burst
//!   of writes costs one rerun at the newest tick; intermediate results are
//!   skipped, never reordered (R1 plan row T11-4).
//! - **Errors.** A query that fails holds its error as its result and is
//!   rerun on every tick until it succeeds (it has no read set to match).
//! - **Trimmed journal.** When the janitor trimmed past the tailer's
//!   position ([`LiveError::JournalTrimmed`]), the manager restarts its
//!   tailer at a fresh timestamp and reruns every subscription there.
//! - **Safety rerun.** Every `safety_rerun` (5 min) every subscription is
//!   rerun and compared; a difference is a missed invalidation, which is
//!   logged with both read sets, counted
//!   ([`SubsStats::missed_invalidations`], the `live_missed_invalidation_total`
//!   metric) and repaired.
