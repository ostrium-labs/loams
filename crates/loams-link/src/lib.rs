//! Loams's link framework (design §09 §1, §3).
//!
//! A link continuously applies a stream to a target. Exactly-once comes from
//! the target: each commit carries the batch's data *and* the offsets it
//! applied, atomically, under optimistic concurrency (the target's version)
//! and the task lease's fence. A crash anywhere re-reads the committed
//! offsets and re-applies only what was not committed; a zombie task (stale
//! epoch) fails its commit.
//!
//! - [`LinkTarget`]: the target contract ([`LinkTarget::load`],
//!   [`LinkTarget::commit`]).
//! - [`LinkApplySource`]: the worker task source, one task per link (plan
//!   ruling 3), at `Priority::LinkApply`, whose targets come from a
//!   [`TargetRegistry`] of [`LinkTargetFactory`]s keyed by the link's target
//!   kind (plan M1.1 Task 10).
//! - [`CounterTable`]: the M0 test target (plan ruling 4): record keys name
//!   counters, values are decimal `i64` deltas, and the table holds sums, so
//!   a double apply is visible. [`CounterTargetFactory`] serves it.
