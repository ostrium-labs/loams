//! Loams's internal log on the `standard` WAL class (design §02 §3, §5, §6).
//!
//! - [`batch`]: Kafka `RecordBatch` v2 encoding of [`Record`]s.
//! - [`wal`] and [`segment`]: the object formats.
//! - [`LogWriter`]: the leaderless write path. Appends are buffered, written as
//!   one multi-partition WAL object per flush, committed to the metastore's
//!   sequencer, and only then acknowledged with their offsets.
//! - [`LogReader`]: fetch by offset through the range cache, with long-poll.
//! - [`SegmenterSource`] and [`RetentionSource`]: worker task sources
//!   (`loams-worker`) that rewrite WAL chunks into per-partition segments and
//!   trim old records; [`Segmenter`] and [`Retention`] run them once.
//! - [`gc`]: garbage collection of retired and orphaned objects, also a
//!   worker task.
