//! SF1's Global Constraint, as an executable claim: **embeds never hold a
//! Loams token**.
//!
//! # Why this test is the important one
//!
//! D627 supersedes E1 and ships the embed on a **persistent** engine profile.
//! E1 could claim the constraint was easy to keep precisely because the store
//! it was reasoning about was ephemeral, and an ephemeral store retains
//! nothing. A persistent profile is the opposite case: it retains everything,
//! including anything a page writes into it, and it survives a restart. So
//! "the embed is a browser on a persistent disk" is exactly the design in which
//! this constraint would be violated by accident, and it needs to be a test.
//!
//! # What is asserted
//!
//! 1. A Loams token, injected the way a careless implementation would inject
//!    it, **is found** by [`audit_profile`]. The check is not vacuous: it has to
//!    fail when something is actually wrong.
//! 2. The same check **passes** on a profile directory built the way this crate
//!    builds one, containing the engine's own `cookies.json` and a
//!    `localStorage/<origin>.json`, holding only the app's scoped session
//!    cookies.
//! 3. The cookie jar the engine reports back contains no Loams token, and the
//!    check catches one that does.
//! 4. The [`LoamsCredential`] type cannot reach a [`ScopedSessionCookie`]: its
//!    `Debug` is redacted, and this crate's own sources never call
//!    `LoamsCredential::expose` outside a test.
//!
//! Points 1 and 4 are the ones that keep the others honest. A boundary test
//! that cannot fail proves nothing, and a redacted `Debug` proves nothing if
//! nothing calls the accessor.
