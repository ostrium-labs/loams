//! What the embed is allowed to navigate to.
//!
//! # Where this comes from
//!
//! SF1 Task 0's spike found that zeron's browser module already solves
//! navigation control, and the mechanism it recorded is the model here
//! (`crates/ui/src/browser/model.rs:131-138` in that project): `http` and
//! `https` only, a host is required, and any URL carrying userinfo is
//! refused. D627 replaces the webview but not that policy — the policy is what
//! makes a browser pointed at an agent-controlled surface safe to leave running.
//!
//! On top of zeron's three rules this adds the one zeron did not need:
//!
//! - **The host must be in the allowlist.** The embedded origin, plus the
//!   identity provider's origins, which is what lets the Authentik redirect
//!   work while the OIDC ceremony itself happens in Loams. Anything else is
//!   refused rather than opened in the system browser, so a link in a chat
//!   message cannot quietly turn the embed into a general-purpose browser.
//!
//! This is also the compensating control for [`crate::net_policy`]: the
//! engine's private-network switch is process-wide, so the per-request scoping
//! has to live here.
