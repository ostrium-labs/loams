//! The docked sidebar browser (design §37 §18, plan [SF1](../../docs/plans/2026-10-02-sf1-collab-ui-plugins.md), decision **D620**).
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! SF1 Task 0 declared the sidebar browser "does not ship on any operating
//! system" (ruling E1), because the per-platform webview it would have been
//! built on has an ephemeral website-data store everywhere, no WebAuthn on the
//! GTK and WPE WebKit ports, and no Windows implementation at all. The owner
//! has overridden E1. This crate is the replacement, and it is a different
//! shape: **no webview is forked or embedded at all.** The rendering engine is
//! Obscura (Apache-2.0, Rust, headless, no Chromium), run as a child process
//! and driven over the Chrome DevTools Protocol.
//!
//! Forking was rejected, and it is worth saying why in the crate's own docs
//! because it is the load-bearing reason for the whole shape: WKWebView and
//! WebView2 are proprietary and cannot be forked, and forking WebKit is a
//! multi-year effort. A separate process over a documented protocol is the only
//! option that is both Apache-2.0-clean and one code path for Linux, macOS and
//! Windows.
//!
//! # How each of E1's three blockers is closed, in code
//!
//! | E1's blocker | Closed by |
//! |---|---|
//! | Ephemeral store on every platform | [`profile::ProfileKey`] gives each `(environment, app)` pair its own directory, and [`ledger::CookieLedger`] persists the app's scoped session cookies there. Loams re-injects them on the next launch. Tests: `tests/persistence.rs`, `tests/isolation.rs`. |
//! | No WebAuthn in WebKitGTK | Loams runs the OIDC/Authentik ceremony itself and hands the engine only post-auth scoped session cookies ([`session`]). The engine never performs a WebAuthn ceremony — and could not: the pinned engine has no WebAuthn implementation at all. Test: `tests/token_boundary.rs`. |
//! | No Windows browser | There is no per-platform webview to be missing. [`engine`] builds one command line that is the same on all three targets. Test: `tests/launch_spec.rs`. |
//!
//! # The security constraint
//!
//! SF1's Global Constraint is "embeds never hold a Loams token", and a naive
//! persistent profile would break it. [`boundary`] is the check that would
//! catch that, and `tests/token_boundary.rs` runs it against a real profile
//! directory holding a real Loams token.
//!
//! # What this is not
//!
//! Not a general-purpose human-interactive browser. See [`panel`] and the
//! crate README's "Fidelity" section: the surface is agent-driven, frames come
//! from a software rasteriser through `Page.startScreencast`, and interaction
//! is routed back as synthetic input events. The embedded targets are Zulip,
//! Plane and Forgejo, which bounds what that costs, and the reason it is
//! bounded is written down rather than assumed.
//!
//! # Engine version
//!
//! Written against Obscura **0.2.3** ([`engine::PINNED_ENGINE_VERSION`]),
//! verified by reading that tag's source. [`engine::check_version`] compares at
//! startup. The README says which release asset to install, and which ones not
//! to.
