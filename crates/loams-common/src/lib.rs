//! Identifier and schema types shared by Loams crates.
//!
//! The metastore allocates ids from per-kind counters, so ids are dense, never
//! reused, and render as plain decimal numbers in object paths (for example
//! `ns/42/streams/7/0/...`, design §01 §6).
//!
//! [`schema`] holds the collection schema types: the metastore's commands
//! carry them, and `loams-collection` re-exports them.
//!
//! [`meta`] holds the metastore's shared types: catalog records, errors and
//! consistency levels, moved from `loams-meta` (M1.2a plan).
