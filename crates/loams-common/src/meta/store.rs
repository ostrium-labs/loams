//! The metastore as every Loams crate outside the composition roots sees it
//! (D47): the [`MetaStore`] trait, its [`Consistency`] levels, the
//! [`Tracked`] result of writes whose outcome may be unknown, and the
//! [`MetaChanges`] watch.
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! - **Semantic, not raw key-value.** Every read is a named domain query that
//!   returns owned records, and every write is one metastore operation taking
//!   typed arguments or a request struct ([`WalCommit`], [`SegmentSwap`],
//!   [`PointerCas`]). No method takes a closure, raw bytes or an untyped
//!   key-value pair, so each backend can serve each call with one native query
//!   or transaction. Pointers are the manifest-pointer domain object:
//!   versioned, compare-and-swap, fenced, freshness-checked, with their keys
//!   validated and `collection/<id>` keys checked against the catalog.
//! - **One call, one snapshot.** Every read returns data from one consistent
//!   state. Composite reads ([`MetaStore::collection_head`],
//!   [`MetaStore::collection_roots`], the garbage-collection queries) exist
//!   where the parts must come from the same state.
//! - **Unknown outcomes stay visible.** [`MetaStore::commit_wal`],
//!   [`MetaStore::swap_segment`] and [`MetaStore::cas_pointer`] return
//!   [`Tracked`], whose `earlier_unknown` says that an earlier attempt within
//!   the call ended with an unknown outcome. A rejection of the final attempt
//!   then does not prove that nothing was applied. Every other write returns
//!   [`MetaResult`].
//! - **Changes are watched, not polled.** [`MetaStore::watch_changes`] returns
//!   a [`MetaChanges`] armed when it is created: any state change applied after
//!   `watch_changes` returns makes [`MetaChanges::changed`] complete. Spurious
//!   wake-ups are allowed; `Err(MetaStopped)` means the metastore stopped and
//!   nothing will change any more.
//! - **Consistency.** [`Consistency::Linearizable`] reflects every write
//!   acknowledged before the call began. [`Consistency::Local`] returns one
//!   consistent state that may be stale; successive `Local` reads through one
//!   handle never go backwards. A backend may serve `Local` as
//!   `Linearizable`.
//! - **Retries live inside the implementation.** A method returns
//!   [`MetaError::NotLeader`], [`MetaError::Timeout`] or
//!   [`MetaError::Unavailable`] only after the implementation's own retry
//!   budget is spent; a write's outcome is then unknown. Every write is
//!   retry-safe, and a retried write may report its first attempt's effect;
//!   each method says how.
//!
//! Rejections arrive as [`MetaError::Rejected`] carrying an [`ApplyError`]; a
//! rejected write changes nothing. Each write lists the rejections it can
//! return besides [`ApplyError::InvalidArgument`] (a malformed name, key,
//! partition count, range or schema), which every write can return.
