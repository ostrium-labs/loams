//! Loams's worker task framework (design §09 §5, §6).
//!
//! Background work (segmenting, retention, link apply, garbage collection) is
//! split into *tasks*, each named by a [`TaskKey`]. [`TaskSource`]s propose
//! the tasks that have work; a [`Worker`] polls them, takes the metastore
//! lease `task/<key>` for each task it runs, and runs it with a [`Fence`] at
//! the lease's epoch and a cancellation signal. The lease is renewed every
//! third of its TTL; a task whose lease is taken over is cancelled, and every
//! metastore commit it attempts with its fence is rejected.
//!
//! Scheduling: candidates are ordered by [`Priority`] (link apply first, GC
//! last), then round-robin across namespaces within a priority, up to
//! [`WorkerConfig::max_concurrent`] tasks in total and
//! [`WorkerConfig::max_per_namespace`] per namespace.
