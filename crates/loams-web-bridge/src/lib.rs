//! The web toolbox's browser providers (design §37 §18.14, §42 §4; decisions
//! D565–D567; plan AP1c).
//!
//! One tool contract — a snapshot with uids, `find`, `click`, `fill`,
//! `wait_for`, a screenshot, a content extraction — and two providers behind
//! it:
//!
//! * [`local::LocalProvider`] drives the browser on the machine the agent
//!   already runs on. It is the default, and the only path for credentialed
//!   work, because the credentials never leave that machine.
//! * [`browser_run::BrowserRunProvider`] drives Cloudflare Browser Run over its
//!   CDP endpoint, for unattended public-web work when no local browser is
//!   available.
//!
//! Which one runs is configuration (`WebBridgeConfig::provider`), not a fork,
//! so a deployment can change its mind without touching its callers.
//!
//! **Two rules shape the remote provider**, and both come from Cloudflare's own
//! documentation rather than from taste:
//!
//! * **Chromium is the default engine.** Kitesurf is a stateless Workers
//!   isolate: Cloudflare states it cannot start "a long-running, authenticated
//!   session that requires persistent state" and cannot negotiate a bot
//!   challenge's TLS fingerprint. It is offered for the throwaway work its
//!   statelessness suits — a screenshot, a scrape, an extraction — and refused
//!   for anything that needs state.
//! * **The egress policy is enforced twice.** In the provider, before every
//!   navigation, and in Browser Run itself through session guardrails. Guardrails
//!   are a Chromium-pool feature, so a Kitesurf session under a hostname allow
//!   list is refused by default instead of running ungoverned.
//!
//! A Cloudflare API token is a secret: it is named by a `secret_ref`, resolved
//! through the host's [`secret::SecretResolver`] at the moment it is needed,
//! registered for scrubbing before it goes on the wire, and never logged,
//! returned, traced or formatted.
//!
//! Nothing here has been run against a live Cloudflare account.
//! `docs/remote-browser-provider.md` records what is verified from the
//! documentation and what is not verified at all.
