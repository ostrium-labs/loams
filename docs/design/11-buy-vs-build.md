# 11 — Buy vs Build

Status: **Approved** · research as of 2026-09-22 (Fluss and Resonate added 2026-09-24; revised 2026-09-25 after the architecture review: dependencies of the dropped Kafka, Bolt/Cypher and ClickHouse surfaces removed, metastore backends and ADBC added; AI data ecosystem integrations added the same day, §17, D51–D56; metastore backends, CI targets, RustFS and OpenFGA revised 2026-09-26, §18, D58–D70; FoundationDB dropped, OTLP and Kafka dependencies added the same day, D71–D74; amended 2026-10-02: Apache Iggy becomes a companion (D405), Fluss proposed as one (D333), Loams Git's gitoxide and sccache rows, D394–D398)

Rule: **buy (embed/fork) everything that is not the differentiator; build the serving layer that closed competitors keep closed.** Only Apache-2.0 / MIT / compatible permissive dependencies. No AGPL, BSL, SSPL or ELv2 code in the engine.

## 1. Embed (library dependencies)

| Component | Crate / project | License | Version (2026-09) | Role in Loams | Notes / risks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Query engine | **Apache DataFusion** | Apache-2.0 | 54.1 (lockstep with Lance 12 / arrow 58) | All planning/execution | Very active ASF project; extensibility proven by InfluxDB 3, GreptimeDB, LanceDB |
| Distributed exec | **datafusion-distributed** | Apache-2.0 | 3.0 (the last release on DataFusion 54; not used in M1) | Multi-node stages over Flight | Young (datafusion-contrib); Ballista rejected (batch-oriented) |
| Collection format | **Lance** (`lance` crate) | Apache-2.0 | 12.0 (file format 2.1 set explicitly; detached versions, M1.1) | Docs, vectors, IVF + scalar indexes | Vendor-led (LanceDB Inc.), fast API churn → pin + trait boundary; small-commit cost → batch via own WAL |
| Full-text | **Tantivy** | MIT | =0.26.2 (feature `quickwit`) | Inverted index, fast fields, aggregations | Healthy, 16k stars |
| KV / PK index / ID map | **SlateDB** | Apache-2.0 (Commonhaus) | 0.16 | PkIndex, vertex-ID maps | Pre-1.0 API; single writer per DB (fits our fencing model); used by HelixDB, Dropbox |
| Consensus | **openraft** | MIT/Apache-2.0 | 0.10.0-alpha.34 (pinned exactly) | Meta Raft (the default `MetaStore` backend), `quorum` journals | API unstable pre-1.0 (alphas break APIs); used in production by Databend |
| Local Raft log | **redb** | MIT/Apache-2.0 | 4.3 | Meta Raft log, vote, snapshot pointer | Pure Rust, ACID, fsync per commit; passes openraft's storage test suite |
| Binary encoding | **postcard** | MIT/Apache-2.0 | 1.1 | Raft log entries, meta snapshot bodies | Stable wire format since 1.0; snapshots add a versioned, checksummed envelope |
| Iceberg | **iceberg-rust** (+ RisingWave fork) | Apache-2.0 | 0.10.1 | Iceberg reads/appends; row deltas via fork | DV writer + RowDelta missing upstream → build and upstream |
| Iceberg compaction | **nimtable/iceberg-compaction** | Apache-2.0 | active | Compaction engine | RisingWave ecosystem |
| Iceberg catalog | **Lakekeeper** | Apache-2.0 | 0.13.6 | REST catalog for tables + external engines (M4) | Postgres backend today (verify pluggable backend; Q2), which can share the M2 Postgres metastore's server; vendor Vakamo sells "Plus"; its catalog-behind-a-trait design is the model for `MetaStore` (D47) |
| Object store I/O | **object_store** (apache/arrow-rs-object-store) | Apache-2.0 | 0.14 | All S3/GCS/Azure/local I/O | Alternative: OpenDAL — pick one (object_store: DataFusion-native) |
| Cache | **foyer** | Apache-2.0 | 0.22 | RAM+NVMe hybrid cache | Used by RisingWave |
| In-memory cache | **moka** | Apache-2.0/MIT | — | H0 metadata cache | — |
| gRPC / HTTP | tonic, axum, hyper | MIT | — | Gateways | — |
| Arrow Flight SQL | arrow-flight (`flight-sql-experimental`) | Apache-2.0 | 58.4 (lockstep with arrow) | Flight SQL server; `DoPut` bulk ingest into collections and streams (M1.2, D49) | The Flight SQL API is marked experimental in arrow-rs → pin with arrow |
| SQL parsing | sqlparser-rs | Apache-2.0 | — | SQL (through DataFusion) | — |
| Qdrant API types | Qdrant protobuf (vendored public protos, 9 files, v1.19.1) + tonic-prost-build; hand-written REST model | Apache-2.0 | 1.19.1 | Qdrant gateway (`loams-qdrant`, M1.4) | `NOTICE` lists the nine protos; `qdrant.proto` drops six internal imports (M1.4 Rulings 2 and 3, D133) |
| Bitmaps | roaring-rs (`roaring`) | Apache-2.0/MIT | 0.11 | Delete bitmaps, filter bitmaps | — |
| HNSW hot tier | **qdrant-edge** | Apache-2.0 | =0.8.0 (M1.3) | HNSW artifacts behind Loams’ `HnswIndex` (R20) | Enables `serde_json/preserve_order`; the workspace turns it on for every build, and the vendored Quickwit code passes with it (M1.1 ruling P5, M1.3 row E58) |
| MCP server | **rmcp** | Apache-2.0 | 3.4.1 (M1.6) | The W0 MCP server (§15) | — |
| Tokenizers | lindera, jieba-rs, ICU4X | MIT/Apache | — | Analyzers | — |
| SQL client (M2; R tests) | **sqlx** (features `postgres`, `mysql`) | MIT OR Apache-2.0 | 0.9.0 | `loams-meta-postgres` (M2) behind `MetaStore` (D58); the `mysql` feature is kept only for the legacy `mysql://` durable backend (D261) until the TiKV backend replaces it; TiDB SQL (D123) is superseded by D260 | Lakekeeper's choice: compile-time-checked `query!` macros with offline data in CI (`SQLX_OFFLINE=true`) and `sqlx::migrate` migrations; one client for both SQL backends. Replaces the tokio-postgres option. The TiDB metastore is superseded by `loams-meta-tikv` over `tikv-client` (D124, §20) |
| DynamoDB client (M2) | **aws-sdk-dynamodb** | Apache-2.0 | 1.128.0 | `loams-meta-dynamodb` behind `MetaStore` (D58) | Custom endpoint for floci and Alternator (`endpoint_url`); one SDK interceptor injects the fault matrix's faults (D60); the SDK reuses `ClientRequestToken` only across its own retries, so application retries set it explicitly (§18 §2.3) |
| OTLP protobufs (M2) | **opentelemetry-proto** (features `gen-tonic`, `logs`) | Apache-2.0 | 0.33.0 | Decoding OTLP/HTTP and OTLP/gRPC logs requests (D73, §02 §7.1) | Its prost and tonic versions must match the workspace's; pinned in the M2 plan (verify) |
| OpenFGA client (M2.x) | **openfga-client** (vakamo-labs) | Apache-2.0 (no NOTICE) | 0.6 | The `OpenFga` implementation of the `Authorizer` trait (D66, D67) | gRPC only (tonic, prost 0.14; protos vendored, no protoc); helpers `TupleModelManager`, `read_all_pages`; maintained by Vakamo, Lakekeeper's vendor; tonic/prost versions must match the workspace's (verify at M2.x) |

### 1.1 Test and client-side dependencies

| Component | Project | License | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ADBC Flight SQL drivers | Apache Arrow ADBC: `adbc-driver-flightsql` (Python), the Go `flightsql` driver | Apache-2.0 | Test-only in the engine: the M1 exit gate runs their conformance tests against Loams (M1.7, D49); the Python SDK's optional `loams.flight` module uses the Python driver (M1.6) | Not linked into the `loams` binary |
| Lance Python bindings | **pylance** (`lance` on import) | Apache-2.0 | Python-SDK extra `loams[lance]`, pulled in by the Ray, Spark and torch extras: direct reads of the fragments of a pinned scan plan (§17 §3, D53) | Version tracks the engine's Lance release (12.x; verify at M2); whether it opens a detached version by id is Q20 |
| Distributed Lance I/O for Ray | **lance-ray** (lance-format/lance-ray) | Apache-2.0 | Python-SDK extra `loams[ray]`: the Ray Data datasource's per-fragment read tasks (§17 §5.3) | Version pinned in the M2 plan (verify) |
| Ray Data | **ray** (`ray[data]`) | Apache-2.0 (Anyscale platform and RayTurbo proprietary) | Python-SDK extra `loams[ray]`: datasource and datasink (M2, D54); M2 gate client | 2.58.0 (2026-08-23); PyTorch Foundation project since 2025-10 |
| Polars | **polars** (Python) | MIT | Python-SDK extra `loams[polars]`: `to_polars()` (M1.6) and the experimental `scan_loams()` IO plugin (M2) | 1.44.2; 2.0 in release candidates (streaming engine default). `register_io_source` is marked unstable upstream. Python package only, never the Rust crates (§5) |
| PySpark | **pyspark** ≥ 4.0 | Apache-2.0 | Python-SDK extra `loams[spark]`: the Python data source `format("loams")` on Apache Spark 4 and Sail (M2, D54); M2 gate client | Sail serves PySpark through Spark Connect (PySpark 4.2 per Sail 0.7.1; verify) |
| PyTorch | **torch** | BSD-3-Clause | Python-SDK extra `loams[torch]` (lower bound only; the user's build is used) | Lance's `lance.torch.data` reader is the base of `loams.torch` |
| Spice (test client) | spiceai/spiceai runtime | Apache-2.0 | Test-only: its Flight SQL connector runs against Loams in the M1.7 Flight SQL gate (D56) | Run as a separate process; never linked (§5) |
| Floci | **floci** (`floci/floci`) | MIT | CI service: the full DynamoDB conformance suite and the nightly AWS deployment job with S3, Lambda, SQS, EventBridge Scheduler and IAM enforcement (D60) | 2.1.0, pinned ≥ 2.1.0 (a Rust-SDK checksum bug was fixed in 2.1.0); seven months old, releases twice a month: new releases are checked against real AWS before the pin moves; never throws `TransactionConflictException` or throttles; `TransactGetItems` isolation is Q22 |
| ScyllaDB Alternator | `scylladb/scylla:6.2.3` | AGPL-3.0 | CI service only, unmodified, never linked or distributed: the DynamoDB backend's single-item conformance subset with `--alternator-write-isolation always_use_lwt` (D60) | The last AGPL release; 2025.1+ is source-available (§5). No transactions. Not a production metastore |
| DynamoDB Local | `amazon/dynamodb-local` | Proprietary (DynamoDB Local License Agreement) | Optional CI second opinion for the DynamoDB suite | 3.3.1; pulled in CI, never redistributed |
| Kafka clients (test, M5) | librdkafka, franz-go, the Apache Kafka Java client | BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, Apache-2.0 | Test-only: the M5 Kafka gateway gate runs their test suites against Loams, stage by stage (D74) | Which suite runs is fixed in the M5 plan; the Java client needs a JVM in CI |
| Postgres, PD + TiKV | `postgres:17`; `tiup playground` (PD and TiKV, no TiDB) | PostgreSQL; Apache-2.0 | CI services: Postgres for the Postgres metastore backend (M2); `tiup playground` with PD and TiKV only for `loams-meta-tikv`, Loams Live, jobs and the TiKV durable backend in track R (D124, D260). The TiDB metastore backend (D124) and TiDB SQL access (D123) are superseded (D260) | Containers run one at a time on the build machine |
| RustFS | `rustfs/rustfs` | Apache-2.0 | Per-PR CI target for the `Store` provider conformance suite and the S3 fault matrix (D61); also the default self-hosted store (§4) | 1.0.0 (1.0.1 once released) |
| Toxiproxy | `ghcr.io/shopify/toxiproxy` | MIT | Nightly end-to-end soaks of each container backend (`timeout`, `reset_peer`, `latency`, `down`) | 2.12.0; driven through its REST API with `reqwest` (the Rust clients are stale) |

### 1.2 Candidates (evaluated, not adopted)

| Component | Crate | License | Version | Possible role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kafka protocol codec | **kafka-protocol** (tychedelia/kafka-protocol-rs) | MIT/Apache-2.0 | 0.18.0 | M5: request and response types for the Kafka gateway, generated from Kafka's message schemas (D74) | Evaluate in the M5 plan against Nisshi's codec |
| Kafka broker reference | **Nisshi**, formerly Tansu (`nisshi-io/nisshi` @ `0822346`) | Apache-2.0 | 0.7.0-pre.2 (2026-07-31; 0.6.0 is the last stable release) | M5: a reference for the Kafka gateway, and a buy candidate for its protocol layer (`nisshi-sans-io`) | Rust Kafka-compatible broker on S3, Postgres, SQLite or memory; pre-1.0 and renamed in 2026; its storage model is its own, so only the protocol layer could be taken; decided in the M5 plan |
| Query federation | **datafusion-federation** (from Spice) | Apache-2.0 | =0.5.5 (the last release on DataFusion 54; 0.5.6+ need 55) | M4: pushing whole sub-plans to remote SQL sources | Evaluate in the M4 plan; like every DataFusion extension it moves in lockstep (risk 21). `datafusion-table-providers` 0.13.1 (Apache-2.0, DataFusion ^54) is the companion crate if connectors are ever needed |

## 2. Fork (take code, own the fork)

| Source | License | What we take | Why fork (not depend) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Quickwit** | Apache-2.0 (since 2025) | `storage`, `directories` (split bundle + hotcache, async directories, warmup), ES DSL → `QueryAst` → Tantivy (`quickwit-query`), the doc-mapper query builder, aggregation merge glue, `StableLogMergePolicy`, `quickwit-datetime`: vendored file by file from `af0591a3` into `loams-quickwit` (R21) | Internal crates, no stable API; Datadog observability roadmap; we need upserts which Quickwit lacks |
| **Qdrant** | Apache-2.0 | `qdrant-edge =0.8.0` behind `HnswIndex` (R20): HNSW, filterable-HNSW links, quantization, payload-filter planner; `lib/segment` is not vendored | Qdrant's storage is local-disk; we need the index code only, as a hot tier |
| **RisingWave iceberg-rust fork** | Apache-2.0 | RowDelta/RewriteFiles, equality & position deletes | Upstream gaps; plan to converge on upstream |
| **Resonate** (`resonatehq/resonate`, `impl/server/core`) | Apache-2.0 | `resonate-core` (protocol types, `ResonateServer` trait), `resonate-plugin`, `resonate-gateway-http`, `resonate-server-blob` (object-storage backend on `object_store` 0.14), HTTP push/poll transports; the differential and linearizability test harness (§14) | Not on crates.io (git-only, workspace 0.10.1); vendor-led by a seed-stage company with fast protocol evolution → pin a git revision, keep Loams’ code behind the `ResonateServer` trait, replace `resonate-auth` with Loams auth |
| **Lakekeeper** (`lakekeeper/lakekeeper` @ `b771dbf`) | Apache-2.0, with a NOTICE ("Copyright 2024-2026 Vakamo Inc.") | Copied and adapted, keeping the NOTICE (Apache-2.0 §4(d)) and marking changes: the v4.12 OpenFGA model components (`authz/openfga/v4.12/components/*.fga`) and the patterns of `authz-openfga`'s `migration.rs` and `reconcile.rs` (D66); from `lakekeeper-storage-postgres/src`, `tasks.rs` (SKIP LOCKED queue), `idempotency.rs` with its migration, `dbutils.rs` (SQLSTATE mapping), `advisory_lock.rs` and the conditional-UPDATE CAS of `tabular/table/commit.rs` (D58). Reference only: the `Authorizer` and `CatalogStore` traits and `authorizer.rs` | Coupled to Iceberg types and Lakekeeper's entities; `CatalogStore` threads one transaction through many calls, which Loams’ one-call-one-transaction trait avoids (D47) |

## 3. Reference designs only (no code)

| System | License | What we learn |
|---|---|---|
| turbopuffer | Closed | WAL-on-S3 + async indexing + tail merge; SPFresh ANN; FTS v2 posting blocks; namespace-affinity caching as a soft hint (about 100k namespaces per node, 250M+ namespaces seen); BYOC with a pull-based ops agent (the BYOC-local-meta model, D64) |
| WarpStream | Proprietary | Leaderless Kafka on S3 served by stateless agents (the model of the M5 Kafka gateway, D74), zone-aware routing, metadata-sequenced offsets (a control plane on DynamoDB, Spanner or Cosmos DB), multi-zonal Express WAL (verify); BYOC where only file metadata crosses to the control plane (the BYOC-managed-meta model, D64) |
| StreamNative Ursa | Proprietary (open-sourcing promised) | Leaderless log protocol (TLA+), WAL → Iceberg compaction |
| AutoMQ | Apache-2.0 (Java) | S3Stream WAL/cache split, EBS multi-attach failover + fencing, S3-proxied cross-AZ produce, Table Topic; Kafka compatibility on object storage (D74) |
| Bufstream (Buf) | Proprietary | A Kafka-compatible broker on object storage with its metadata in a separate store (etcd, Postgres or Spanner; verify) and Iceberg-native topics: a reference for the M5 Kafka gateway (D74) |
| ClickHouse / ClickHouse Cloud | Apache-2.0 / proprietary | MergeTree granules, sparse PK index, skip indexes, projections (for the Iceberg hot tier, §04 §3); SharedMergeTree, Shared Catalog, distributed cache |
| StarRocks (shared-data mode) | Apache-2.0 | Stateless compute over Iceberg on S3 with a two-tier (RAM + NVMe) data cache: the pattern §04 applies to Lance, Tantivy and adjacency files as well |
| Nebula Graph | Apache-2.0 | Distributed graph database with three stateful daemons (`metad`, `graphd`, multi-Raft `storaged` over RocksDB): what a separate GraphRAG graph store costs to operate, and why §07 keeps expansion inside the query engine |
| Kuzu / LadybugDB | MIT (C++) | Columnar graph storage, CSR, factorized execution, WCOJ |
| DuckPGQ | MIT | CSR built from edge tables inside a relational engine; SQL/PGQ |
| Apache GraphAr | Apache-2.0 | Chunked CSR/offset layout (also import/export) |
| HelixDB v3 | Apache-2.0 | Graph + vector on SlateDB/S3 with foyer + tantivy (closest OSS rival) |
| Neon | Apache-2.0 | Quorum WAL (safekeepers) + S3 pageserver split |
| Milvus 3.0 | Apache-2.0 (Go/C++) | Lake-native "external collections" over Lance/Iceberg/Parquet/Vortex; Woodpecker zero-disk WAL |
| GreptimeDB, RisingWave (Hummock), InfluxDB 3 | Apache-2.0 | Stateless frontends + object-store engines + metasrv patterns |
| Databend | Apache-2.0 + Elastic License 2.0 | Stateless warehouse on S3, meta-service on openraft (whose upstream it maintains). Since 2026 it has been repositioned as an "agent-ready" warehouse (analytics + full-text + vector search + sandboxed Python UDFs), which makes it a competitor for M1/M4 (see §12 risk 11). It is SQL-first, with no Qdrant/ES compatibility and no graph expansion |
| Apache Fluss | Apache-2.0 (Java) | Columnar (Arrow) log with projection pushdown, primary-key tables that emit changelogs with before images, union reads of fresh log + lakehouse, tiering to Iceberg/Paimon/Lance. Taken as ideas: `arrow` segment encoding (§02 §5) and changelog streams (§02 §8.1). Not embeddable (JVM, ZooKeeper, tablet-server disks); a competitor for M4/M5 (§12 risk 11). Its Rust client, `fluss-rust` 0.1 in this row's original research, was a possible interop target, not a dependency; the Rust client current at Fluss 1.0.0 is `fluss-rs` 1.0.0 (§32 §3, checked 2026-10-01), used only in `fabric/` (D343). *Proposed 2026-10-01 (D333, §32):* Fluss 1.0 as the Event Fabric's real-time table layer, run as a companion beside Iggy; it graduated from incubation on 2026-07-16 |
| Resonate specification | Apache-2.0 | Lean 4 executable abstract machine, TLA+ model, property catalogue and a trace checker that replays a real server's traffic against the model: a reference for M0.4's simulation and linearizability checks alongside Octopii |
| Octopii | Apache-2.0 | Deterministic simulation of openraft clusters (simulated time and RNG, VFS fault injection, partitioned in-memory network, cluster oracle): the reference for M0.4's simulation harness. Not adopted: it vendors a modified openraft, is not on crates.io, has a single maintainer, and pulls in `protobuf` 2.x (RUSTSEC-2024-0437) |
| DiskANN (Rust) | MIT | SSD-resident ANN for larger-than-RAM hot tier (Phase C evaluation) |
| Vortex | Apache-2.0 (LF AI & Data) | Future local/hot encoding option |
| Apache Iggy | Apache-2.0 | Thread-per-core io_uring design, VSR clustering, DST practices. Also a companion since 2026-10-02 (§4, D405) |
| MosaicML Streaming | Apache-2.0 | Elastic determinism (a seeded shuffle over canonical partitions, `num_canonical_nodes`) and mid-epoch resume: the model for `loams.torch`'s sampler (§17 §5.5) |
| Sail (object-store shuffle) | Apache-2.0 | Stateless workers with blocking shuffle to object storage and checkpointing (0.7): a reference for M6's distributed shuffle |
| TileDB | MIT (core) | Timestamped fragments and named retained snapshots (the idea behind dataset tags, D52); a tensor column type (Q19) |
| Neki (PlanetScale) | Proprietary (public docs only) | A versioned data topology replaced whole and pushed to stateless routers; routers that buffer writes during cutover; no atomic cross-shard commits in its preview: references for the namespace directory and moves (D63, §18 §5.8) |
| PgDog | **AGPL-3.0** (reference only; no code copied) | Rust Postgres router: shard routing, scatter-gather, two-phase commit with a coordinator WAL, resharding by logical replication, centroid-based vector sharding (`pgdog-vector`) (D63) |

## 4. Companions (run alongside, not embedded)

| System | License | Role next to Loams | Integration surface | Why not embed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lakekeeper | Apache-2.0 (Rust) | Iceberg REST catalog (bundled, M4); shares one OpenFGA store with Loams (D67, default) | Iceberg REST | Already listed in §1; separate process by design |
| OpenFGA server | Apache-2.0 | Fine-grained authorization for the `OpenFga` authorizer (M2.x, D67) | gRPC through `openfga-client` | A separate service by design, shared with Lakekeeper |
| RustFS | Apache-2.0 (contributions need a CLA with RustFS, Inc.; the commercial `license` feature is off by default) | The default local and self-hosted object store (D61), replacing MinIO | S3 API | A separate server; Loams reaches it through `object_store` like any S3 endpoint |
| Spice | Apache-2.0 (Spice.ai Enterprise proprietary) | Federation and acceleration for agent apps, with Loams as a Flight SQL source (M1 gate, D56); also a competitor (§12 risk 11) | Flight SQL | Ships forks of DataFusion and arrow-rs (§5) |
| Sail | Apache-2.0 (Rust) | Spark Connect compute for PySpark curation jobs: reads collections through `format("loams")` (M2) and tables through Iceberg REST (M4 gate, D55) | Python data source; Iceberg REST | DataFusion version lockstep (§5) |
| Ray | Apache-2.0 | Distributed curation, embedding backfills and batch inference over collections (M2) | Scan plans + Lance fragments; Flight `DoPut` | Python compute cluster, run by the user |
| Apache Iggy | Apache-2.0 (Rust) | The Event Fabric's ingest log and protocol edge beside the Loams WAL (owner ruling D405; §32 §5.2, D332), unmodified, server 0.9.0 | Iggy's SDKs and connectors runtime; the `loams_sink` and `fluss_sink` plugins (FL1) | A separate service by design; pre-1.0 wire protocol (D332) |

Stream-processor companions (RisingWave, Arroyo, Flink) connect over the Kafka gateway in M5, which brings back the RisingWave integration (D22, D74). Before M5, RisingWave writes to Loams through its Elasticsearch, HTTP and Iceberg sinks (§02 §7.3).

### 4.1 Candidates for agent workspaces (§15, proposed)

| Component | Project | License | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Git objects and packs | **gitoxide** (`gix-*`) | Apache-2.0 / MIT | Pack parsing, indexes, protocol, SHA-1/SHA-256 | Server-side upload-pack/receive-pack not implemented upstream → build the server loop. Pack encoding without delta compression and bitmap writing are also unchecked upstream (2026-10-01): repacking uses stock `git` as a process (D396) |
| Lazy, deduplicated images | **nydus** (Dragonfly) | Apache-2.0 (Rust) | Environment images (RAFS v6 / EROFS), chunk dedup, lazy fetch | Verify its storage backend can use Loams’ bucket or cache |
| Chunking / hashing | fastcdc, BLAKE3 | MIT / Apache-2.0 | Content-defined chunks for the namespace CAS | — |
| FUSE | fuser | MIT | Userspace mounts where virtiofs/EROFS are unavailable | — |
| Code parsing | tree-sitter | MIT | Symbol chunks and code graphs | — |
| MCP | Rust MCP SDK (`rmcp`) | Apache-2.0 | MCP server and gateway on the 2026-07-28 stateless spec | 3.4.1 supports 2026-07-28 (M1.6 plan; §1) |
| Session parsing and pricing | **tokscale-core** (tokscale) | MIT (Rust) | Parse Claude Code, Codex, opencode (and ~30 other harnesses') session files into `token_usage` (§16 §6) | Library crate of the tokscale CLI; parity check against the CLI |
| Build cache | sccache, bazel-remote | Apache-2.0 | sccache v0.18.0: direct S3/R2 path with no Loams code, or a Loams WebDAV gateway path for metering hooks, LRU and trust (D398) | — |
| Sandbox runtimes | microsandbox (libkrun), Firecracker, Cloud Hypervisor, Kata, gVisor, E2B, Anthropic `sandbox-runtime`, Codex | Apache-2.0 | `loams-sandbox` backends: microsandbox (default), Firecracker (fleet), gVisor (Kubernetes without KVM), process (dev only) (§15 §8) | Integrated through a `Runtime` trait, never forked |
| References | git-remote-object-store, awslabs/git-remote-s3, AgentFS, Jujutsu, mountpoint-s3, JuiceFS | Apache-2.0 / MIT | Designs to learn from | — |

| Qdrant as storage | Apache-2.0 | Local-disk architecture (use its index code only) |
| Quickwit as a service | Apache-2.0 | Append-only; duplicates our metastore/ingest (use its crates) |
| S3 Vectors | AWS service | Top-k ≤ 100, ~1k writes/s per index, no hybrid search — cold tier at best |
| ClickHouse OSS text index | Apache-2.0 | No BM25/positions — filter, not relevance |
| Spice runtime as a library | Apache-2.0 | Patches crates.io with forks of DataFusion 54 and arrow-rs (and Ballista, iceberg-rust, Vortex, mistral.rs forks); embedding it ties Loams to Spice's fork cadence (D51). Integrate over Flight SQL instead |
| Sail crates | Apache-2.0 | Main is on DataFusion 55.1 / arrow 59.2 against Loams’ 54 / 58 (Lance 12); its maintainers declined Rust-level Lance integration for the same reason; no Spark Connect surface is planned (D42, D51) |
| Polars crates (`polars`, `polars-arrow`) | MIT (`polars-arrow`: MIT AND Apache-2.0) | A second Arrow implementation (arrow2 fork), so every boundary converts; Python users get zero copy through PyCapsule anyway (D51) |
| TileDB core, `tiledb-rs` | MIT; `tiledb-rs` has no license | `tiledb-rs` is unlicensed and early work; the core pins arrow 55 / DataFusion 47 in its Rust parts; activity slowing; its vector search depends on tiledb-cloud (D51) |
| Petastorm | Apache-2.0 | Maintenance mode; deprecated by Databricks in favour of Mosaic Streaming; requires pyspark; Lance's PyTorch reader covers it (D51) |

## 6. Build (the moat)

These are what turbopuffer, LanceDB Enterprise, AutoMQ commercial and ClickHouse Cloud keep closed — and what Loams ships open:

1. **Hybrid planner**: dense + sparse vector + BM25 text + filter + graph expansion + fusion in one DataFusion plan, with tail merge and consistency tokens (§05).
2. **Stateless serving fleet**: affinity routing, H0–H3 caching, hot-tier lifecycle — the StarRocks data-cache pattern extended to Lance pages, Tantivy splits and adjacency (§04).
3. **Collection engine**: Lance + Tantivy under one manifest, upserts via PK index + delete bitmaps, tail indexes (§03, §06).
4. **Graph engine for GraphRAG**: ID maps, chunked CSR/CSC sidecars, edge overlay, `ExpandExec` and shortest path, graph table functions, the `expand` search stage, and the LightRAG and LlamaIndex graph-store adapters (§07).
5. **Compatibility gateways**: Qdrant, the Elasticsearch subset scoped by the framework suites (D48), and Arrow Flight SQL with `DoPut` ingest (§05, §06).
6. **Log engine** with `standard` / `express` (multi-zonal quorum) / `quorum` (Raft journals) WAL classes, leaderless sequencing, segmenting, `kafka`/`arrow` segment encodings, changelog streams with fenced appends, and the native streaming API with idempotent producers and named consumers (§02).
7. **Links**: exactly-once declarative materialization with transforms and `embed()` (§09).
8. **Pluggable metastore**: the semantic `MetaStore` trait with openraft, Postgres and DynamoDB backends and a TiKV backend in track R (D124; it supersedes the M6 TiDB backend), held to one conformance and linearizability suite and a fault matrix per backend, plus the sharded metastore and namespace router (§01 §3.2, §18, D47, D58–D63).
9. **Iceberg hot tier**: T0 file index, hot projections (MergeTree-on-NVMe), real-time tail (§04 §3).
10. **Iceberg DV writer / RowDelta** — contributed upstream to iceberg-rust.
11. **Durable-execution integration**: the Resonate surface on Loams’ store, auth and routing; in Phase B the change stream, search index, execution graph and cluster-wide timer shards (§14).
12. **AI data ecosystem surface**: scan pinning, retained dataset tags, credential vending for direct fragment reads, and thin Python adapters for Ray Data, Polars, PySpark/Sail and PyTorch, over open formats and protocols only (§17, D51–D54).
