# 19 — Console, Identity and Agents

Status: **Proposed** · 2026-09-26. Decision numbers are assigned at merge; until then they are P1–P10. This document builds on §18 §6–§8 (D64–D66) and amends one line of D65 (the tenancy model, P2).

> **Amended 2026-10-02** by [§38](38-knative-authentik-gitops.md) (proposed): Authentik's open-source edition is the documented and tested IdP in front of Loams, replacing Keycloak as the SAML broker in P7 and §6 (D447, D450). People sign in through it; the gateway exchanges its token for a Loams access token (RFC 8693, §5.2 flow 1) and stays the authority for Loams tokens; agents, vending and §5.3 are unchanged (D449). The single binary keeps built-in sign-in (D450). §3's hosted identity ("Clerk or Keycloak") is not changed here; it is `loams-platform`'s decision (Q442).

Markers: **(verify)** is not checked against a primary source; the plan that builds it resolves it.

## 1. Summary

| # | Proposal | Milestone |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | **One console, three editions.** A React single-page app serves OSS, Loams Cloud and BYOC. The engine embeds its build and serves it at `/ui`; the hosted control plane serves the same build | Mock-backed now; real with M2 |
| P2 | **Org → projects → environments.** A project groups environments; an environment is exactly one namespace. Amends D65's "org → namespaces" | M2 |
| P3 | **One org per OSS install.** The schema keeps `org_id` everywhere; Cloud runs many orgs on the same model | M2 |
| P4 | **Teams** hold members and receive project roles; OIDC groups can map to teams | M2 |
| P5 | **Agents are principals**, beside users and service accounts: owned by a project, with a capability policy, a token TTL cap and their own audit trail | M2 |
| P6 | **Agents hold no long-lived secrets.** They get short-lived, scoped access tokens by workload-identity federation, user delegation (OAuth 2.1 + PKCE, for MCP clients) or vending from a parent token | M2 (federation, delegation); W1 (vending, §15 §8) |
| P7 | **Human sign-in in OSS:** first-run setup token, email and password (argon2id) with TOTP, and generic OIDC SSO. Passkeys follow. SAML and SCIM are brokered by an IdP (Authentik by default since §38 D447; Keycloak, Dex, Authentik), not built in | M2; passkeys M2.x |
| P8 | **Auth is Rust, in the gateway**, on the `ControlStore`: no Node service beside the binary. Built from primitives, not a framework | M2 |
| P9 | **The console API contract** is OpenAPI 3.1 at `api/console/openapi.json`, the single source for the console's types, the mock server and the gateway's implementation | Now |
| P10 | **`loams-console-mock`**, the contract and seed data with `routes()`, served before the gateway does by `loams-apps-mock` on one listener | Now |

## 2. Why

§18 decided orgs, API keys, quotas and an `Authorizer` (D65, D66) but not how people and agents sign in, how a company organizes many applications, or what the console is. Three facts shape the answer:

1. **Self-hosters run one binary.** Anything that needs a second runtime (a Node auth server, Redis, a SQL database the operator did not choose) breaks the single-binary and air-gapped story (§10 §1).
2. **Most traffic will come from agents, not people.** Coding agents and application agents call the query, MCP and document APIs with credentials someone pasted into an environment variable. A long-lived key in a sandbox is the weakest point of the system (§15 §1, "Scoped credentials").
3. **A company has many applications and stages.** "One namespace per tenant" (§01 principle 5) is right for isolation, but a team with a search feature in staging and production needs those two namespaces grouped, with shared access and separate keys.

## 3. Editions and the console (P1)

| | OSS | Loams Cloud | BYOC |
|---|---|---|---|
| Console | Embedded, `/ui` on the native REST listener | Hosted | Hosted, managing the customer's cluster |
| Orgs | Exactly one | Many | One per customer |
| Identity | Built in (§6) | Built in, or an external IdP (Clerk or Keycloak) through OIDC | The customer's IdP through OIDC |
| Billing | None | Plans and metered usage | Contract |

The console discovers what it can show from `GET /api/v1/instance` (`edition`, enabled sign-in methods, feature flags), so one build serves all three. Cloud-only pages (billing) are hidden, not forked.

**Build and serving.** The console lives in `web/` (a pnpm workspace: `apps/console` and `packages/ui`, the shared `@loams/ui` design system). The `loams` crate embeds `web/apps/console/dist` behind a `console` feature and serves it with an SPA fallback at `/ui`; without the feature the binary builds with no Node toolchain. Fonts and assets are bundled: an air-gapped console loads nothing from the internet.

## 4. Tenancy (P2, P3, P4)

```
org ─┬─ members (users)            roles: owner, admin, member
     ├─ teams ── members
     ├─ projects ─┬─ environments ── namespace (1:1) ── collections, streams, links
     │            ├─ access: team or user → project role (admin, developer, viewer)
     │            ├─ agents
     │            └─ service accounts
     └─ audit log
```

- **Environment = namespace.** Isolation, quotas, encryption keys, routing and billing stay per namespace (§01 principle 5, §18 §6); an environment adds a human name (`production`), a slug and a `protected` flag. The namespace name is `<project>-<environment>` by default and is shown in the console.
- **Protected environments** (production, by default) require the project `admin` role for destructive actions: dropping a collection, deleting documents in bulk, creating API keys, and widening an agent's policy.
- **Roles map onto D66's `Rbac`**: a project role expands to `read`, `write` or `admin` grants on the project's namespaces. The `Authorizer` interface does not change; bindings gain a project scope.
- **OSS has one org** (P3), created at first-run setup. Multi-org self-hosting (agencies, holding companies) is a Cloud or BYOC concern.

## 5. Principals and agents (P5, P6)

Every request resolves to a principal. There are three kinds:

| Kind | Who | Authenticates with |
|---|---|---|
| `user` | A person | A console session (§6), or an access token from OAuth 2.1 |
| `service_account` | A non-human workload that is not an agent: a batch job, a CI pipeline | Workload-identity federation, or an API key |
| `agent` | An AI agent: a coding agent, an application's assistant, an MCP client | Short-lived access tokens only |

### 5.1 An agent

An agent is registered in a project and has:

- **an owner** (a user or team) accountable for it, and a description;
- **a policy**: the environments it may reach, and per environment the actions (`collections:read`, `collections:write`, `query`, `documents:delete`, `streams:produce`, `mcp:tools`) and optionally the collections;
- **a TTL cap** for its tokens: 15 minutes by default, at most 1 hour;
- **trust policies** that say which external identities may act as it (§5.2);
- **limits**: its own request-rate and concurrency quotas, below the namespace's (§18 §6);
- **a status**: `active` or `suspended`. Suspension revokes every token at once (§5.4).

Every token an agent holds and every call it makes is attributed to it in the audit log, including the user it acts for.

### 5.2 How an agent gets a token

There are three flows, and none of them stores a secret in the agent's environment.

1. **Workload-identity federation** (RFC 8693 token exchange). The agent's runtime already issues it an OIDC token: GitHub Actions, a Kubernetes service account, AWS, GCP or Azure workload identity, or a sandbox runtime. The agent posts that token to `POST /api/v1/oauth/token`. The gateway verifies it against a **trust policy** on the agent (issuer, audience, a subject pattern such as `repo:acme/search:ref:refs/heads/main`), then issues a Loams access token.
2. **User delegation** (OAuth 2.1 authorization code with PKCE). An MCP client such as Claude Code or Codex discovers the authorization server the way the MCP authorization spec (2026-07-28) prescribes. A request without a token to a protected route gets `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="<origin>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"`. That document (RFC 9728) names the resource, the authorization server and the supported scopes, and the server's own metadata is at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (RFC 8414). `GET /api/v1/oauth/authorize` sends the user to the console's consent screen, which runs inside a signed-in session and shows the agent, the environment and the actions. The user's answer goes to `POST /api/v1/oauth/consent`; the gateway issues a code (or `error=access_denied`) and returns the client's `redirect_uri`, which the console follows. The resulting token carries the user as the subject and the agent as the actor, and it can never exceed either one's rights.
3. **Vending** from a parent token (§15 §8). A sandbox supervisor holding a token asks for a narrower one for a sandbox: fewer actions, one environment, a shorter TTL. Vended tokens can only attenuate.

### 5.3 Access tokens

- **Format:** a JWT signed by the instance's Ed25519 key, published at `/.well-known/jwks.json`. Claims: `sub` (the principal), `act` (the actor chain, RFC 8693 §4.1), `org`, `env` (audience: one environment), `scp` (actions), `col` (optional collection list), `exp`, `iat` and `jti`.
- **Lifetime:** the agent's TTL cap (15 minutes by default, 1 hour at most). There are no refresh tokens for agents: they exchange again. Users' access tokens last 1 hour, with refresh tokens bound to the session.
- **Verification** is local in every gateway (signature, `exp`, `env` against the request's namespace, `scp` against the action), so it adds no round trip. The `Authorizer` still decides; the token only narrows what the principal may do.
- **Sender-constrained tokens** (DPoP, RFC 9449) are a follow-up for agents that run outside a sandbox.

### 5.4 Revocation

Short lifetimes are the main defence. On top of that, the gateways keep a revocation set of `jti`s and suspended principals, pushed through the `ControlStore` change feed, as §18 §6 does for API keys. Suspending an agent takes effect within the change feed's latency, not the token's TTL.

### 5.5 API keys

API keys stay for SDK users and service accounts that cannot federate (§18 §6: `loams_<key_id>_<secret>`, hashed). Proposed additions:

- every key is scoped to one environment;
- keys default to a 90-day expiry;
- the console marks keys that were not used for 30 days;
- keys cannot be issued to agents. The CLI follows this rule (D295, §30 §15): `loams keys create` makes keys for apps, written to `.env.loams`; the stdio MCP server never mints or returns keys, and from CLI3 it acts as an agent principal with vended tokens.

## 6. Human sign-in in OSS (P7)

| Method | In OSS | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| First-run setup | Yes | See the lifecycle below; `/ui/setup` creates the org and its owner, and the token then stops working |
| Email and password | Yes | argon2id (`argon2` 0.6); lockout after repeated failures; can be turned off once SSO works |
| TOTP two-factor | Yes | `totp-rs` 6, with recovery codes; an org setting can require it |
| OIDC single sign-on | Yes, several providers | Keycloak, Okta, Entra ID, Google Workspace, Authentik, Dex, GitHub (through Dex). Just-in-time provisioning, allowed email domains, group-to-team mapping. `openidconnect` 4 |
| Passkeys (WebAuthn) | M2.x | `webauthn-rs` 0.5 (MPL-2.0, used unmodified as a separate crate) |
| Magic links | No | They need SMTP, which many self-hosters do not run |
| SAML, SCIM | No | Put an IdP in front: Authentik's open-source edition brokers SAML to OIDC and is the documented, tested choice (§38 D447); Keycloak, Dex or any OIDC IdP also works. SCIM is a Cloud and BYOC feature |

**The setup token** is a bootstrap credential, so it never goes into a log sink:

- **Generation:** 32 random bytes, created at startup only while no org exists; a restart before setup replaces it.
- **Delivery:** it is written to `<data_dir>/setup-token` with mode `0600`, readable only by the server's user. The log says where the file is, never its content. It is also printed to the terminal only when standard error is an interactive TTY. Operators who automate installs pass their own token with `--setup-token-file`.
- **Expiry:** 1 hour after it is created. Setup then needs a restart, which makes a new token.
- **One use, atomically:** `/api/v1/setup` compares the token in constant time and, in the same `ControlStore` transaction that creates the org and its owner, deletes it and records that setup happened. A second request fails whether it races the first or comes later, and once an org exists the endpoint answers `404` whatever the token.

**Sessions** are an `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax` cookie holding an opaque id; the session lives in the `ControlStore` (12 hours idle, 30 days absolute). Mutating requests carry a CSRF token from `GET /api/v1/session`.

Sign-in methods do not depend on the edition: OSS gets SSO and two-factor. Loams charges for running Loams (Cloud, BYOC, support), not for security features.

## 7. Implementation: Rust primitives on the `ControlStore` (P8)

Auth runs in the gateway role, stores its state in the `ControlStore` (§18 §6), and decides through the `Authorizer` (§18 §7). That rules out the Rust auth frameworks we reviewed on 2026-09-26, because each one owns its storage:

| Framework | Why not |
|---|---|
| `better-auth` 0.10 (better-auth-rs) | 1.0 is in alpha; storage is SeaORM (SQL only), with a Redis cache; its org and session tables would sit outside the `ControlStore`, and openraft- or DynamoDB-backed installs have no SQL database |
| `torii` 0.5 | Last release 2025-12-23; SQL storage (SQLite, Postgres, MySQL) |
| `auth-framework` 0.4 | Young, one maintainer, and it bundles a whole authorization server whose security we would have to audit |

Loams builds the flows itself (sessions, exchange, consent, vending) on audited primitives:

| Need | Crate |
|---|---|
| OIDC client (SSO, and verifying federated tokens) | `openidconnect` 4 (MIT) |
| JWT signing and verification (EdDSA) | `jsonwebtoken` 11 (MIT) |
| Password hashing | `argon2` 0.6 (MIT or Apache-2.0) |
| TOTP | `totp-rs` 6 (MIT) |
| Passkeys | `webauthn-rs` 0.5 (MPL-2.0) |

better-auth's plugin boundaries and its organization, team and invitation shapes are a useful reference for naming; no code is copied.

## 8. The contract and the mock (P9, P10)

- **`api/console/openapi.json`** (OpenAPI 3.1) defines every `/api/v1` operation the console uses, plus the OAuth endpoints (token exchange, authorize, the consent decision) and the well-known documents (RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata, RFC 8414 server metadata, JWKS). The console generates its TypeScript types from it (`openapi-typescript`); the gateway's handlers are tested against it in M2.
- **The data API is not in it.** The console reads collections through the existing native API (`/v1/namespaces/{ns}/collections`, the M1.6 wire contract W6–W9), using the environment's namespace.
- **`crates/loams-console-mock`** holds the contract and **seed data**: one org (Acme), three teams, projects with development, staging and production environments, agents with trust policies and live tokens, API keys, audit events, usage series, and collections in the seeded namespaces. `routes()` turns the seed into one response per contract path, and **`loams-apps-mock`** serves those routes over axum on `127.0.0.1:8084` beside the app protos, so `cargo run -p loams-apps-mock` backs the console, the desktop, the phone apps and the SDKs from one listener; `pnpm dev` in `web/` proxies `/api` and `/v1` to it. It was a standalone `httpmock` server on `:8081` until the two surfaces were unified; `httpmock` now only backs this crate's contract tests.
- **Two tests keep the three in step:** every contract operation has a mock, and every seed record carries its schema's required properties.
- The mock is static: a `POST` returns a plausible created object, but the next `GET` does not show it. That is enough to build and review the console; state belongs to the real gateway.

## 9. Risks and open questions

1. **Amending D65** (P2) adds a level between org and namespace. The M2 plan must check that the directory (§18 §5.2) and name lookups keyed by `(org, name)` need nothing else: environments are metadata over namespaces, not a new routing key.
2. **Token exchange is security-critical code we write.** Mitigations: RFC test vectors, a fuzz target for token parsing, and a review by someone outside the team before M2 ships.
3. **MCP authorization** is still moving; the contract follows the 2026-07-28 revision (protected-resource metadata, §5.2), and resource indicators (RFC 8707) need checking against it (verify).
4. **Clock skew** matters for 15-minute tokens: verification allows 60 seconds.
5. **Q:** should service accounts be able to federate in OSS in M2, or only agents? The proposal says both.
6. **Q:** is one org per OSS install right for large companies that want separate orgs per business unit? The alternative is Cloud or BYOC.
