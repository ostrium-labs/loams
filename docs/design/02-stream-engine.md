# 02 — Stream Engine

Status: **Approved** · 2026-09-22 · revised 2026-09-25 (native streaming API, D43) · revised 2026-09-26 (the stream API core and OTLP logs ingest in M2, the Kafka gateway in M5, D72–D74) · amended 2026-09-26 (envelope encryption of WAL chunks, D96; collection write backpressure, D86) · amended 2026-09-30 (CloudEvents 1.0 ingest and consume, §7.4, D270)

Goal: a partitioned log with **AutoMQ-grade reliability** (RPO 0 on node and AZ loss, seconds-level failover, no data on broker disks) and a choice of latency/cost per stream, reached through Loams’ native streaming API and, from M5, the Kafka wire protocol — and it is the internal spine for every other object in Loams.

---

## 1. Requirements

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| R1 | Acknowledged writes survive loss of any node and any single AZ (RPO 0) for all default classes |
| R2 | Failover in seconds; no partition reassignment data copying (data lives in S3) |
| R3 | Selectable latency per stream: ~500 ms p99 (cheapest) → ~20–50 ms → < 10 ms |
| R4 | Avoid cross-AZ data transfer charges where the class allows |
| R5 | Native produce and consume over HTTP, gRPC and Arrow Flight: idempotent producers, long-poll and streaming reads, named consumers with committed offsets |
| R6 | Serve as the implicit log for tables/collections/graphs, with offsets usable as consistency tokens |
| R7 | From M5, Kafka clients produce and consume through the Kafka wire protocol (§7.2) |
| R8 | Events enter and leave as CloudEvents 1.0 (HTTP binary, structured and batched modes; protobuf over gRPC; Kafka binary mode as the record layout), deduplicated by `source` + `id` on the `/events` route and `ProduceCloudEvents` (§7.4) |

## 2. WAL durability classes

| Class | Mechanism | Ack after | p99 produce (target) | Survives AZ loss | Cross-AZ data $ | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `standard` | Multi-partition WAL objects on **S3 Standard** (or GCS/Azure regional) | PUT success + meta offset commit | 400–600 ms | Yes | None | Bulk ingest, logs, collection/table ingest, cost-first streams |
| `express` | WAL objects written in parallel to **3 zonal buckets** (S3 Express One Zone / GCS Rapid) in 3 AZs; ack on **2 of 3** | 2 PUTs + meta commit | 20–50 ms | Yes | None (object-store writes, not VM-to-VM) | Latency-sensitive streams without running stateful disks |
| `quorum` | **Journal**: openraft group of 3 `log` nodes (1 per AZ), WAL on local NVMe, offloaded to S3 | Majority fsync | 3–10 ms | Yes | Yes (2 replica copies per byte) | Lowest latency; on-prem (RustFS); clouds without zonal object storage |

Notes:
- `express` is Loams’ answer to AutoMQ's commercial EBS/Regional-EBS WAL: low latency and multi-AZ durability **without stateful broker disks**. A similar multi-zonal-bucket approach has been described by WarpStream (verify). Express storage is expensive ($0.11/GB-month) but WAL objects live only seconds before offload; Express PUTs are cheaper per request than Standard.
- On Azure, `express` may map to a single zone-redundant Premium block-blob account (verify). If no zonal/low-latency object store exists, `express` is unavailable and `quorum` is the low-latency option.
- A future `blockvol` class (AutoMQ-style EBS WAL with multi-attach failover) can be added behind the same trait; not planned for v1.

## 3. Leaderless write path (`standard`, `express`)

Modeled on WarpStream/Ursa: any `log` node may accept writes for any partition; ordering is assigned by the metastore at commit.

```
producer ──► log node (same AZ, via zone-aware discovery)
               │ 1. buffer batches from all partitions/namespaces
               │    until flush_interval (standard 250 ms / express 5 ms) or 8 MiB
               │ 2. PUT wal/<class>/<node>/<ulid>.wal   (If-None-Match: *)
               │    express: PUT to 3 zonal buckets in parallel, wait for 2
               │ 3. meta.CommitWal{object, chunks:[(partition, count, bytes, producer_seq…)]}
               │    → sequencer assigns base offsets, checks idempotence, appends index entries
               │ 4. ack each produce with its base offset (+ consistency token)
```

**WAL object format:** `header(magic, version, node_id, ulid, class) | chunk* | chunk_index | footer(crc32c, index_offset)`. Each chunk holds one partition's record batches and names its `encoding` (§5): Kafka's `RecordBatch` v2 byte format by default (a compact, CRC-checked, well-specified batch format), so the segmenter moves batches without re-encoding. Chunks are sorted by `(stream, partition)` (stream ids are cluster-unique). WAL objects live at the cluster level, `wal/<class>/<node_id>/<ulid>.wal`, since one object holds many namespaces (D25). The exact byte layout (format version 1) is in the [M0.3 plan](../plans/2026-09-24-m0.3-log-engine.md#task-2-records-kafka-recordbatch-v2-and-the-wal-object-format).

**Encryption (M2, D96).** A namespace with a customer-managed key has its chunks envelope-encrypted, because one WAL object holds many namespaces and a per-object KMS key cannot cover it. Each such chunk is sealed with AES-256-GCM under its own data key; the data key is wrapped by the namespace's current key-encryption key, which the log node gets from the KMS once per namespace and hour and holds only in memory (stored wrapped at `ns/<id>/keys/<ulid>.key`). The chunk header carries the wrapped data key and the key's id, in WAL format version 2; readers still decode version 1. Chunks of namespaces without a key are written as today. The segmenter decrypts a chunk and writes its segment under `ns/<id>/` with the provider's per-object KMS key. Destroying the namespace key makes its chunks unreadable while the other chunks of the same object stay readable (crypto-shredding, D69).

**Commit window:** `CommitWal` carries the WAL object's creation time (its ULID time). The sequencer dedupes a retried commit by object path, rejects a commit more than 15 minutes older than its clock (`StaleCommit`), and prunes dedupe records after 30 minutes; writers stop starting new commit attempts after 60 s. A retried commit therefore returns the first commit's offsets or is rejected; it is never committed twice (D27). A rejection proves nothing was committed only on a first attempt: after an attempt whose outcome was unknown, the first attempt may have committed the object and its dedupe record may since have been pruned, so the writer reports such a rejection as `CommitUnknown`. The meta leader refuses commands stamped more than 60 s ahead of its own clock, so one node with a fast clock cannot push the metastore clock forward and make every later commit stale (§10 §2).

**Sequencer (in meta):** per partition keeps `next_offset`, high watermark, producer-state table (last 5 batch sequences per producer id, as Kafka does), and an **offset index**: `(base_offset, count, object_ref, byte_range, max_timestamp)`. One Raft proposal per node flush (batched across partitions) keeps meta load proportional to *nodes × flush rate*, not partitions.

**Failure semantics:**

| Crash point | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Before PUT completes | Nothing durable; producer times out and retries |
| After PUT, before meta commit | Orphan WAL object (GC after grace period); producer retries; no duplicates |
| After meta commit, before ack | Data durable; producer retries → idempotent producers dedupe via sequence numbers; producers without ids may duplicate |

**Zone awareness:** any `log` node accepts produce and fetch for any partition, so routing only has to pick a node in the client's AZ. Nodes record their AZ in the node registry; the native API's node discovery (`GET /v1/cluster/nodes?zone=<az>`, used by the SDKs) returns same-AZ `log` nodes, and Kubernetes deployments can use topology-aware Service routing instead. The client's AZ comes from SDK configuration or the cloud instance metadata. Produce and fetch therefore never cross AZs for `standard`/`express`.

## 4. Quorum write path (`quorum`)

```
producer ──► journal leader (log node)
               │ 1. append RecordBatch to Raft log (openraft), replicate to 2 followers (other AZs)
               │ 2. commit on majority fsync → assign offsets deterministically in state machine
               │ 3. ack
               │ background: seal WAL range → write segment to S3 → commit segment index to meta
               │             → Raft log truncated up to sealed offset (snapshot = segment pointers)
```

- A **journal** hosts many partitions; partitions are assigned to journals by the placement controller in meta.
- Failover = Raft election (target 1–3 s). Acknowledged data is on ≥2 AZs ⇒ RPO 0.
- Followers serve fetches of committed data, so consumer reads stay AZ-local.
- Producers reach the leader, which is cross-AZ for ~2/3 of producers unless placement co-locates leaders with producer AZs (placement hint per stream). Document the cross-AZ cost clearly; it is the price of < 10 ms.
- Partition move between journals: seal + offload to S3, flip ownership in meta; no bulk copy.

## 5. Segmenting and storage

- **Segmenter** (worker task) rewrites WAL chunks into per-partition **segments** (64–256 MiB target), with a footer holding a per-batch offset and timestamp index. Commit = atomic, lease-fenced swap of index entries in meta: a segment becomes **one** index entry covering its data region (D26). The metastore retires WAL objects once no index entry references them, and GC deletes them after a grace period (D27). The segment byte layout (format version 1) is in the [M0.3 plan](../plans/2026-09-24-m0.3-log-engine.md#task-3-segment-format).
- `quorum` journals write segments directly on seal.
- Segments keep the WAL's batch bytes verbatim ⇒ segmenting never re-encodes, and fetch decodes straight from the cached byte range. This holds for both encodings below: the WAL writes each stream's `encoding` directly (an `arrow` stream's WAL chunks already hold Arrow IPC batches), so the segmenter only regroups batches and adds the footer.
- **Segment encodings** (idea from Apache Fluss's columnar log tables). WAL chunks and segments carry an `encoding` field:
  - `kafka` (default): the `RecordBatch` v2 byte format, as above. Explicit streams use it.
  - `arrow`: Arrow IPC record batches, for streams with a registered schema, which includes the implicit streams of tables and collections. The footer adds per-column byte ranges, so link apply and tail readers fetch only the columns they project (column pruning on the log itself) and skip JSON decoding. Record-oriented reads of an `arrow` stream (HTTP and gRPC fetch) build records on the fly, while Flight `DoGet` serves it without conversion, so the encoding is chosen per stream by who reads it most.
  - The field is reserved from the first format version (M0.3); `arrow` ships with stream → table links (M4), with an earlier evaluation for collection implicit streams (M1).
- **Retention:** time/size policies trim partitions metadata-first (the log start moves forward; wholly trimmed index entries are dropped and their objects retired), objects are deleted after grace. Size retention never trims a partition's newest index entry, as Kafka never deletes the active segment.
- **Compacted streams:** a compaction task per partition range keeps the latest record per key, honoring tombstone retention (`tombstone_retention`), producing new segments and swapping index entries.

## 6. Read path

Fetch `(partition, offset, max_bytes)` from any `log` or `query` node in the consumer's AZ:

1. Resolve via the node's cached offset index (kept current by meta watch streams).
2. Serve from, in order: in-memory tail cache → NVMe cache → WAL object (range GET) → segment object (range GET).
3. Long-poll: block on meta high-watermark notifications (the metastore's applied-index watch, M0.3) until records arrive or `max_wait_ms` passes. A gRPC `Subscribe` (§7) is the same loop held open.

Read amplification control: reads of recent data are coalesced per WAL object (one GET feeds many consumers/partitions), and the tail cache is populated at write time on the writing node and on AZ peers.

## 7. Stream APIs

Streams are reached through Loams’ own API. The HTTP produce and long-poll fetch routes exist from M0.3. **M2 completes the core for v1.0** (D72): gRPC, idempotent producers, streaming subscribe, named consumers and stream admin. OTLP logs arrive through their own endpoint in M2 (§7.1). M5 adds Flight `DoGet` replay, changelog streams (§8.1) and the Kafka wire-protocol gateway (§7.2). Streams and namespaces are addressed by name. Collection writes go through a collection's implicit stream and are refused with 429 and `Retry-After` while the collection's unapplied backlog is at or above its budget (D86), unless a write sends `Loams-Backpressure: off`, which admits bulk loads up to 4× the budget; explicit streams have no apply backlog, and M2's ingest-bytes quota bounds them (D65).

| Feature | Design | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| Stream admin | `POST /v1/namespaces/{ns}/streams` (name, partitions, retention), `GET /v1/namespaces/{ns}/streams` (list, paginated), `GET …/streams/{stream}` (per-partition log start and high watermark, retention), `PATCH …/streams/{stream}` (retention), `DELETE …/streams/{stream}` (drop: the stream is hidden at once and its objects retired); gRPC has the same calls. Adding partitions and compaction settings come later | M0.3 (create, describe); M2 (list, retention changes, drop; D72) |
| Produce (HTTP) | `POST /v1/namespaces/{ns}/streams/{stream}/partitions/{p}/records` with JSON records (`key`/`value` base64, `headers`, `timestamp_ms`); the response carries `base_offset`, `last_offset` and a consistency token. M2 adds `POST …/streams/{stream}/records` (partition by key hash, else round-robin) and a plain-JSON body: a JSON array or JSON lines of objects, each object a record's value, which is what Fluent Bit's and Vector's `http` outputs send (§7.3) | M0.3; M2 (partitionless route, plain-JSON body) |
| Long-poll fetch (HTTP) | `GET …/partitions/{p}/records?offset=&max_bytes=&max_wait_ms=` (§6); at the high watermark it waits up to `max_wait_ms` (at most 60 s) and returns empty, not an error | M0.3 |
| gRPC | `Produce` (unary and client-streaming) and `Fetch` with the HTTP semantics and raw bytes instead of base64; `Subscribe` (server-streaming) pushes batches from a start position: an offset, `earliest`, `latest`, a timestamp, or a named consumer's committed offset | M2 (D72) |
| Idempotent producers | `InitProducer` (HTTP `POST /v1/namespaces/{ns}/producers`) returns a `producer_id` and an `epoch`; re-initializing under the same producer name bumps the epoch and fences the older instance. Each produce carries `(producer_id, epoch, sequence)` per partition. The sequencer (§3) dedupes by producer id and sequence: a retried batch returns its original offsets without appending, a sequence gap is rejected (`out_of_order_sequence`), a stale epoch is rejected (`fenced`). Producer state expires after an idle TTL (default 24 h) | M2 (D72) |
| Named consumers | A consumer is a namespace object whose committed offsets `(consumer, stream, partition) → offset` live in the metastore, committed and read through `…/consumers/{name}/offsets` (gRPC `CommitOffsets`, `GetOffsets`). Commits are coalesced per consumer and partition and batched into metastore proposals (§9). There is no membership or rebalance protocol: instances read the partitions they are given, and for exclusive ownership an instance takes a per-partition lease (the lease-and-epoch mechanism of worker tasks, §09 §6), which fences its offset commits. Lag (high watermark − committed offset) is exported as a metric | M2 (D72) |
| Flight bulk ingest | Flight SQL's bulk-ingest `DoPut` (`CommandStatementIngest`; the ADBC Flight SQL Go driver sends it for bulk ingest since ADBC Libraries 22, apache/arrow-adbc#3808, and the Python `adbc-driver-flightsql` wraps that driver; the driver's documentation page still says bulk ingest is not implemented) with a target in the `streams` schema appends rows as records: columns `key`, `value`, `headers`, `timestamp` and an optional `partition` (else by key hash) for `kafka` streams; `arrow` streams take batches of their registered schema as-is (from M4). `CommandStatementIngest` returns only a row count; a plain `DoPut` with the path descriptor `["streams", s(, p)]` returns one `PutResult` per batch whose `app_metadata` carries the consistency token and offsets (D49; M1.2 Task 13) | M1.2 |
| Flight replay | `DoGet` with a ticket naming a stream, partitions and an offset or timestamp range returns Arrow batches (`partition`, `offset`, `timestamp`, `key`, `value`, `headers`; the registered schema for `arrow` streams) | M5 |
| Auth | API tokens, TLS/mTLS and namespace-scoped RBAC apply to every route (§10 §4) | M2 |

The native API offers neither multi-partition transactions nor server-side consumer-group assignment. Kafka consumer groups (M5, §7.2) assign partitions for Kafka clients.

**The M2 gate for the core** (D72): no acknowledged write is lost across node kills; idempotent producers write no duplicate when they retry; a named consumer resumes from its committed offset across a node restart; fetch returns each partition's records in offset order. M5 extends this to the Jepsen-style tests across node and AZ kills (§12).

### 7.1 OTLP logs ingest (M2, D73)

An OTLP endpoint for **logs only**, so log shippers write to Loams with no custom plugin (§7.3).

- **Transports.** OTLP/HTTP at `POST /v1/logs`, with protobuf (`application/x-protobuf`) or JSON (`application/json`) bodies, gzip allowed; OTLP/gRPC `LogsService/Export`. Default ports are the OTLP defaults, 4318 (HTTP) and 4317 (gRPC).
- **Target.** The namespace and stream come from the `loams-namespace` and `loams-stream` headers (gRPC metadata), which every OTLP exporter can set, and default to the API key's namespace and the stream `otel_logs`. The API key goes in `Authorization: Bearer` (§10 §4).
- **Mapping.** Each `LogRecord` becomes one record. The value is one self-contained JSON object: the record in OTLP's JSON encoding, with its resource and scope attributes merged in. The timestamp is `time_unix_nano`, else `observed_time_unix_nano`, else arrival time. The key is empty (round-robin) unless the stream names a key attribute, such as `service.name`, which keeps one service's logs in order. Trace id, span id and severity number are also copied into record headers, so links can filter without parsing the value.
- **Acknowledgement.** A request succeeds once all its records are committed. Records that fail validation are reported in `partial_success`. Over quota, the endpoint returns HTTP 429 or gRPC `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` with a retry delay, which OTLP exporters retry. OTLP has no producer ids, so an exporter that retries after a lost response can write duplicates: OTLP ingest is at-least-once.
- **Into a collection.** A stream → collection link (§09) makes the logs searchable through the native API and the Qdrant and ES surfaces, visible through the tail within seconds.
- **Not in M2.** Traces and metrics arrive with W1's agent telemetry (§15, §16 §6). `arrow`-encoded OTLP streams wait for the `arrow` encoding in M4 (D20); M2's OTLP streams use the `kafka` encoding with JSON values.

### 7.2 Kafka wire-protocol gateway (M5, D74)

> **Amendment (2026-10-01, §32 D331–D332; approved 2026-10-02, Q331, D408):** event ingestion moves to the Event Fabric (Apache Iggy and Apache Fluss, [§32](32-loams-flow-fabric-house.md) §5), and Kafka clients of the Fabric use Iggy's Kafka gateway with Loams’ contributions; this gateway is deferred, not cancelled (D408). Streams keep their roles for Loams’ own objects, OTLP logs and trigger-rate CloudEvents (§7.1, §7.4).

The Kafka protocol is Loams’ long-term source-compatibility protocol. With it, Loams streams are readable and writable by RisingWave, Flink, Spark, Kafka Connect, Debezium, Fluent Bit's `kafka` output and Vector. WarpStream, AutoMQ and Bufstream show the model: a Kafka-compatible log on object storage, with stateless brokers. Nisshi (formerly Tansu; Apache-2.0, Rust, a Kafka broker on S3 or Postgres) is a reference (§11 §1.2).

- **Mapping.** A Kafka topic is a Loams stream, a Kafka partition is a stream partition, and Kafka offsets are Loams’ dense offsets. How topic names map to namespaces and how SASL carries the API key is Q26.
- **Leaderless.** Any `log` node accepts produce and fetch for any partition (§3), so `Metadata` names a node in the client's zone as the leader of every partition, as WarpStream does. A Kafka `Metadata` request carries no rack: `client.rack` reaches a broker only in a consumer's `Fetch` (v11+, KIP-392), and producers never send it. The zone therefore comes from the client id, WarpStream's `ws_az=<zone>` convention (verify), or from a per-zone bootstrap address. A client with neither gets any live `log` node, so its traffic may cross zones.
- **No re-encoding.** `kafka`-encoded WAL chunks and segments already hold `RecordBatch` v2 bytes (§3, §5). Produce validates the client's batches and the sequencer assigns their offsets; Fetch serves the stored bytes with the assigned `baseOffset`. The segmenter already patches it into segments, and a batch read from a WAL chunk, which still carries the producer's value, gets it from the offset index. `baseOffset` is outside the batch CRC, so nothing is re-encoded. `arrow` streams are served by building batches on the fly.
- **Staged within M5:**
  1. `ApiVersions`, `Metadata`, `Produce`, `Fetch` and `ListOffsets`, with SASL over TLS; the topic admin calls the gated tools need map to stream admin (§7).
  2. Idempotent producers: `InitProducerId` maps onto the native producer ids and epochs (§7), so the sequencer's dedupe applies unchanged.
  3. Consumer groups with committed offsets: the classic group protocol (`FindCoordinator`, `JoinGroup`, `SyncGroup`, `Heartbeat`, `OffsetCommit`, `OffsetFetch`) first, then KIP-848 server-side assignment (`ConsumerGroupHeartbeat`). A group's coordinator runs on the rendezvous owner of `(ns, group)` (§18 §5.3); its committed offsets live in the metastore like a named consumer's, and commits are conditional on the group's generation, so a stale coordinator cannot commit.
- **Not in M5:** Kafka transactions (transactional ids, `AddPartitionsToTxn`, `EndTxn`, read-committed isolation). A later milestone adds them on demand (Q4).
- **Companion.** The RisingWave companion integration (D22) returns in M5 over this gateway (deferred by D408, so RisingWave reads the Event Fabric instead, §32 D341): RisingWave reads streams and changelog streams through its Kafka source and writes back through its Kafka sink.
- **Gate.** The Kafka client test suites (librdkafka, franz-go or the Java client) pass against Loams, stage by stage; RisingWave, Flink and Kafka Connect run end to end (§12).
- **Rejected alternatives.** A Kinesis-compatible subset reaches fewer tools and would become redundant once Kafka exists. A RisingWave-only native connector is not needed: the Kafka gateway covers RisingWave.

### 7.4 CloudEvents 1.0 (D270)

Streams accept and serve [CloudEvents 1.0](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/spec.md), the envelope the CPU-time runtime's gateway uses for async events (D184). An event is stored as one ordinary record, laid out as the CloudEvents [Kafka protocol binding](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/bindings/kafka-protocol-binding.md) lays out a binary-mode Kafka message, so a stream of events is also a valid Kafka topic of CloudEvents for the M5 gateway (§7.2), and nothing in the log, the segmenter or links knows about CloudEvents.

**Mapping.**

| CloudEvents | Record |
|---|---|
| `specversion`, `id`, `source`, `type`, `subject`, `time`, `dataschema`, each extension `x` | Header `ce_specversion`, `ce_id`, …, `ce_x`: the attribute's string form as UTF-8, in the event's attribute order |
| `datacontenttype` | Header `content-type`, as the Kafka binding does |
| `partitionkey` extension, else `subject` | Record key (UTF-8). An event with neither has no key |
| `time` | Record timestamp, in ms (the header keeps the exact string); absent: the writer's clock |
| `data` / `data_base64` | Record value: the bytes of `data_base64`; the JSON text of `data` when the data is JSON (`datacontenttype` absent or JSON); the string's UTF-8 otherwise. No data: no value |
| `source` + `id` | The idempotency key (below), never stored as a separate field |

An extension whose value is not a string in its format (a JSON number or boolean; a protobuf `ce_integer`, `ce_boolean`, `ce_uri`, `ce_uri_ref`, `ce_timestamp` or `ce_bytes`) also gets one entry in the header `loams_ce_types` (`name=integer,other=boolean`, …), so it is written back with its type. Only structured JSON and protobuf output read that header. Binary-mode output (HTTP `ce-*`, Kafka `ce_`) omits it, since those headers carry strings only, so an extension ingested in binary mode is a string when read back; types survive the structured and protobuf paths.

**Validation.** An event is refused, with the attribute named, when `specversion` is not `1.0` (0.3 events included), when `id`, `source` or `type` is missing or empty, when `time` is not RFC 3339, when an attribute name is not 1 or more lowercase ASCII letters and digits (the spec's 20-character limit is a SHOULD, so longer names are accepted), when an attribute other than an extension has the wrong JSON type, or when both `data` and `data_base64` are present. A batch is all or nothing: one invalid event refuses the batch with its index, before anything is claimed or written. A batch that repeats a `source` + `id` is coalesced before the claim: its first occurrence is appended, and every later occurrence is answered `duplicate` with the first's partition and offset, so one request appends at most one record per key.

**Deduplication.** CloudEvents promise that `source` + `id` identify an event, so ingest is idempotent per stream. The key is SHA-256(`source` ‖ 0x00 ‖ `id`), scoped by stream id, in a metastore ledger (native idempotent producers, §7, dedupe by producer sequence and do not fit events from many independent sources):

1. **Claim.** One metastore proposal per request claims every event's key for the node, pending for 2 minutes (longer than a writer's 60 s commit budget, §3). A key already done returns the first write's partition and offset (`duplicate`); a key pending under another claim returns `in_flight`.
2. **Append** the claimed events in one `append_many`.
3. **Complete.** One proposal marks the keys done with their offsets, kept for the **dedup window**: 1 hour by default, set with `--cloudevents-dedup-window` in seconds (at most 24 hours). A definitely failed append (nothing was committed) releases its claims. A `CommitUnknown` outcome (§3) keeps them: the append may have committed, so the claims lapse after 2 minutes like a dead node's and a retry then may append again, as below.

A retry within the window therefore never appends twice, and the answer to a retry names the original offset. One case duplicates: a node that appended but died before completing leaves a pending claim, and a retry after it lapses appends again. Nothing is lost: a claim that was never appended lapses the same way. A retry after the window is a new event. Expired entries are pruned with the WAL commit records (§3), by the retention task. The ledger costs two small proposals per request and about 80 bytes per event for the window, so it suits trigger, webhook and agent event rates; bulk ingest should use plain produce. Plain produce (`…/records`) is never deduplicated, even when its records carry `ce_` headers; so the Kafka binary mode row below is a record layout, not a deduplicated route (the M5 gateway may route `ce_`-headed records through the ledger later).

**Ingest.**

| Binding | Route or call | Body |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP binary mode | `POST /v1/namespaces/{ns}/streams/{stream}/events`, with `ce-*` headers (percent-decoded) | The data; `Content-Type` is `datacontenttype` |
| HTTP structured mode | The same route, `Content-Type: application/cloudevents+json` | One event in the JSON format |
| HTTP batched mode | The same route, `Content-Type: application/cloudevents-batch+json` | A JSON array of events |
| gRPC | `StreamService.ProduceCloudEvents` | A request naming the namespace, stream and optional partition, with a `CloudEventBatch` in the [protobuf format](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/formats/protobuf-format.md) (`io.cloudevents.v1`), or a `json_batch`: the batched JSON format as bytes, read like the HTTP batched mode. `proto_data` is refused (its `type_url` has no place in a record). A protobuf map has no order, so a protobuf event's attributes are the required four, then the extensions by name |
| Kafka binary mode | Plain produce (§7) today, the Kafka gateway from M5 | Records with `ce_` headers, as the table above; stored as sent |

A request with neither a `ce-specversion` header nor a CloudEvents content type gets 415. The partition is the `partition` query parameter (gRPC field) if given, else the Kafka default partitioner (murmur2 of the key, modulo the partition count) so the M5 gateway agrees, else, for an event without a key, the idempotency key's hash, so a retry lands on the same partition. The answer lists, per event, `status` (`appended`, `duplicate` or `in_flight`), `partition` and `offset`, and carries the consistency token of the appended events. HTTP answers 200, or 409 with `Retry-After` when any event is in flight; retrying the whole request is always safe. gRPC answers per event and fails only for invalid events (`INVALID_ARGUMENT`) or an unavailable log.

**Consume.** `GET /v1/namespaces/{ns}/streams/{stream}/partitions/{p}/events` takes the fetch parameters (§7, `offset`, `max_bytes`, `max_wait_ms`) and `mode`:

- `mode=structured` (default): `application/cloudevents-batch+json`, one event per record; the headers `Loams-Next-Offset` and `Loams-High-Watermark` carry what fetch returns in its body.
- `mode=binary`: the record at `offset` as one binary-mode HTTP message (`ce-*` headers, `Content-Type`, the value as the body) with `Loams-Offset` and `Loams-Next-Offset`; 204 when the wait ends with no record.

A record is read back in the first form that applies:

1. **Ingested as CloudEvents, or produced with `ce_` headers that pass the validation above** (`specversion` `1.0`, and `id`, `source` and `type` present): the event is rebuilt from the headers, the value and `loams_ce_types`. Attribute names, values and order round-trip byte for byte in every format, with one exception: protobuf carries `time` and timestamp extensions as `ce_timestamp` (seconds and nanos), so protobuf output writes them in canonical RFC 3339 UTC form and an offset or trailing fractional zeros of the ingested string are not kept (gRPC consume, which writes protobuf, is not built yet); extension types round-trip where `loams_ce_types` is present (structured JSON and protobuf ingest). A record with partial or invalid `ce_` headers takes step 3. JSON data written with no `datacontenttype` (or a JSON one) comes back as the same JSON text in `data`; text comes back as a `data` string; anything else as `data_base64`.
2. **Kafka structured mode** (`content-type: application/cloudevents+json`): the value is the event, validated and passed through unchanged.
3. **Any other record:** a synthesized envelope. `specversion` `1.0`; `id` `{stream_id}-{offset}` (unique even if the stream is dropped and recreated under its name); `source` `/namespaces/{ns}/streams/{stream}/partitions/{p}`; `type` `io.loams.dev.stream.record`; `time` the record timestamp in RFC 3339 UTC with milliseconds; `partitionkey` the key, when it is UTF-8 (a binary key is left out); `datacontenttype` the record's `content-type` header if any, else `application/json` when the value is JSON, else `application/octet-stream` with `data_base64`. Other record headers are not carried.

gRPC consume waits for gRPC fetch (§7, D72).

**Codec.** A small hand-written codec (`loams-cloudevents`). `cloudevents-sdk` 0.9 (Apache-2.0, released about once a year) was checked and not taken: it parses `time` into `chrono` and extension values into typed values and writes them back normalized, which breaks the byte-for-byte round trip; it has no protobuf format; and it pulls in `chrono`, `url`, `uuid`, `hostname` and `snafu`.

**Dapr.** `deploy/dapr/edge` passes Dapr's pub/sub CloudEvents and webhook CloudEvents (binary or structured) through to `ProduceCloudEvents` unchanged, keeping only Dapr glue: sidecar-only pub/sub routes, the webhook token, the Workflow guard and Dapr's `SUCCESS`/`RETRY`/`DROP` answers. Deduplication by `source` + `id` replaces the edge's own invocation id, so a `Produce` that timed out after appending no longer appends again when Dapr redelivers. Publishers keep `id` stable across their own retries (Dapr's `cloudevent.id` publish metadata, or a publisher-built CloudEvent).

## 8. Streams as the internal spine

- Every table, collection and graph has an **implicit stream** (default class `standard`; configurable). Writes via the native API, Flight `DoPut` and the Qdrant and ES gateways are appended there, then materialized by links (§09).
- Explicit streams can be linked to tables/collections, so a stream *is* queryable without connectors.
- Offsets returned to writers form **consistency tokens** (§01 §5).

### 8.1 Changelog streams (idea from Apache Fluss)

Every keyed table and collection can expose a **changelog stream**: one record per row-level change, read through the native streaming API (§7) like any other stream.

```sql
CREATE STREAM tickets_changes AS CHANGELOG OF COLLECTION tickets
  WITH (mode = 'full');          -- or 'upsert'
```

| Mode | Records | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `upsert` | `+U` (new row) and `-D` (key) | No extra reads |
| `full` | `+I`, `-U` (before image), `+U` (after image), `-D` (before image) | One read of the old row per update, located through the PK index (§03 §5) and usually cached |

- **Who writes it:** the link-apply worker that resolves upserts and deletes through the PK index already knows the old row, so it appends the batch's change records to the changelog stream before it commits the target.
- **Exactly-once:** the sequencer records, per changelog partition, the highest source offset already appended (`source_upto`). The append is **fenced**: it is accepted only if the worker's lease epoch is current and the batch covers source offsets starting at `source_upto + 1`. The changelog commits before the target, so a crash between the two re-runs the apply; the retried worker reads `source_upto`, appends only changes beyond it, and then commits the target. No change is lost or duplicated.
- **Ordering:** per key, changelog order equals commit order of the source partition. The changelog is partitioned like its source.
- **Uses:** syncing agent memory to caches and external systems, CDC out of Loams (any native-API or Flight client can consume it), and incremental consumers inside Loams (graph links, rollups) that need deletes and before images.
- **Record format:** rows with a row-kind column (`+I`, `-U`, `+U`, `-D`) and the primary key, as Arrow through Flight `DoGet` and links, or as JSON records (key = primary key) over HTTP and gRPC.
- Phase: M5 (collections and keyed tables), with the native streaming API.

## 9. Capacity and cost sketch

Example: 1 GiB/s ingest, 20 `log` nodes, `standard` class, 250 ms flush.

| Item | Estimate |
|---|---|
| WAL PUTs | 20 nodes × 4/s = 80 PUT/s ≈ 207 M/month ≈ **$1.0k/month** |
| Meta proposals | ~80/s WAL commits + offset commits (coalesced) — well within a 3-node Raft group |
| Storage | S3 Standard at $0.023/GB-month × retained bytes (no replication multiplier) |
| Cross-AZ | ~0 with zone-aware routing |

Tuning `flush_interval` trades PUT cost against latency; `express` trades storage/upload fees against latency; `quorum` trades cross-AZ transfer (≈ $0.02/GB for two replica copies, AWS pricing) against latency.

## 10. Open questions

1. Meta scaling beyond one Raft group: shard sequencer state by namespace range (multi-Raft) — design at M6.
2. `express` on GCS Rapid and Azure: confirm conditional-write and append semantics per provider.
3. Whether native named consumers need server-side partition assignment beyond per-partition leases. Kafka clients get it from consumer groups (§7.2).
4. `arrow` encoding: Arrow IPC per chunk vs. one Arrow file per segment with a column index (either layout keeps the WAL's batch bytes, §5).
5. Changelog retention default (same as the source's implicit stream, or shorter) and whether `full` mode is allowed on collections with large documents.
6. CloudEvents dedup window per stream instead of per server, and a cap on ledger entries per namespace, if the ledger's memory (§7.4) matters at event rates beyond webhooks and triggers (Q270).
