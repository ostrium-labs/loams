# 09 — Links & Workers

Status: **Approved** · 2026-09-22 · amended 2026-09-26 (M1.2 as built) · amended 2026-09-26 (collection write backpressure, D86)

**Links** are Loams’ zero-ETL mechanism: declared, continuously maintained materializations from streams into tables, collections and graphs. **Workers** are the stateless pool that executes links and all other background work.

---

## 1. Link types

| Link | Example | Target commit |
|---|---|---|
| `stream → table` | Stream `llm_calls` → Iceberg table | Iceberg snapshot (via Lakekeeper) |
| `stream → collection` | Stream `support_tickets` → searchable, embedded collection | Collection manifest |
| `table → collection` | Search projection of `products(title, description)` | Collection manifest |
| `table/collection → graph` | Edge table `knows` → CSR/CSC sidecars of a mapped graph (§07 §2.1) | Graph manifest |
| `table → table` | Materialized view / rollup (§08 §4) | Iceberg snapshot |
| `table/collection → changelog stream` | Row-level changes of `tickets` as a stream (§02 §8.1) | Fenced append to the changelog stream, before the target commit |
| `durable_events → table/graph` | Durable-execution search index and execution graph (§14 Phase B) | Iceberg snapshot / graph manifest |
| implicit | Every table/collection/graph's own implicit stream → itself | per target |

```sql
CREATE LINK tickets_search
  FROM STREAM support_tickets
  INTO COLLECTION tickets
  TRANSFORM (
    SELECT key AS _pk,
           json_get_str(value, '$.subject') AS subject,
           json_get_str(value, '$.body')    AS body,
           embed('endpoint:text-embedding-3', json_get_str(value, '$.body')) AS body_vec,
           timestamp AS ts
  )
  WITH (batch_bytes = '64MiB', batch_interval = '2s', on_error = 'dead_letter');
```

## 2. Transforms

- SQL (DataFusion) over the decoded record batch: projections, filters, JSON extraction, casts, scalar UDFs.
- Decoders: JSON, Avro/Protobuf (with a registered schema), CSV, raw bytes.
- **`embed()` UDF (optional):** calls an external embedding endpoint (OpenAI-compatible HTTP, or a self-hosted model server) with batching, retries and rate limiting; results cached by content hash. Off by default; configured per namespace. (Loams does not host models.)
- Mergeable aggregate states for MV-style links (§08 §4).
- Not supported: stateful joins across streams, windowed aggregations with watermarks (§00 §7).

## 3. Exactly-once semantics

1. A link task leases `(link_id, source_partition_range)` in meta with an epoch.
2. It reads from the last **applied offset** recorded in the target's latest commit (Iceberg snapshot summary property / collection or graph manifest field).
3. It builds target files, then commits the target **including the new applied offsets**.
4. A zombie task (stale epoch) fails its commit: Iceberg optimistic concurrency / manifest-pointer CAS rejects it; leases are also fenced by epoch.
5. Restart = resume from the committed applied offset. Duplicate work after crashes is discarded, never double-applied.
6. A link with a changelog appends change records before the target commit, fenced by epoch and by the changelog's recorded `source_upto`; the retried task skips what is already appended (§02 §8.1).

## 4. Errors, dead letters, schema evolution

- `on_error`: `fail` (pause link, alert), `skip`, or `dead_letter` (write offending records + error to a DLQ stream).
- Source schema changes: additive fields auto-propagate if the target allows (Iceberg schema evolution, collection dynamic mapping); incompatible changes pause the link with a clear error.
- Link lag (offsets and seconds) exported as metrics and exposed in `system.links`.

## 5. Worker task catalog

| Task | Trigger | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Segmenter | WAL objects pending | Stream segments; WAL deletion |
| Stream compaction | Compacted stream dirty ratio | New segments |
| Retention | Policy schedule | Segment/file deletions |
| Link apply | Source lag > 0 | Target commits |
| Split merge | Split count/size tiers | Merged Tantivy splits |
| Lance compaction / vector index optimize | Fragment count, unindexed rows, centroid drift | New Lance version / index |
| Hot artifact build | Promotion or pin; new manifest version | HNSW / projection artifacts |
| Iceberg compaction | Small files, delete ratio | Rewritten data files (nimtable/iceberg-compaction) |
| Iceberg maintenance | Schedule | Snapshot expiry, orphan cleanup, manifest rewrite |
| Graph sidecar build | New/compacted edge segments | CSR/CSC sidecars |
| Graph algorithms | User job | Result tables/columns |
| GC | Schedule | Unreferenced object deletion (§03 §7) |
| Meta snapshot | Raft log size / schedule | Snapshot to S3 |
| Durable timer sweep (§14 Phase B) | Timer shard lease | Fires due promise/task/schedule deadlines |
| Durable retention (§14) | Policy schedule | Deletes settled origin documents past retention |

**As built in M1.3** (task keys under the lease `task/<key>`, with their priorities):

| Task | Key | Priority | Trigger | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Split merge | `collection-merge/<cid>` (per namespace) | `Compaction` | `StableLogMergePolicy` plans a merge of splits with the same schema version, or a split with ≥ 30 % (and at least 1 000) deleted docs is rewritten alone; bounded by `max_merge_docs` (10 M) and `max_merge_bytes` (1 GiB) | One split re-indexed from `_source`, committed as a `Maintenance` manifest with rebase |
| Lance compaction | `collection-compact/<cid>` (per namespace) | `Compaction` | Enough small fragments, or a fragment's deleted share over the threshold | Lance's rewrite committed as a detached version, then a `Maintenance` manifest |
| Hot artifact build | `hot-build/<cid>/<i>` (per namespace; `i` the vector index) | `HotBuild` | A column pinned or promoted with no artifact, or a stale artifact past the rebuild threshold (M1.3 Ruling 16) | An HNSW artifact under `hot/hnsw/…`, referenced by a `Maintenance` manifest |
| Learner eviction | `meta-membership` (cluster-wide) | `Maintenance` | Every 60 s in cluster mode | Removes metastore learners whose `node/<id>` lease has been expired for 10 min |

Known limits carried to M2's resource budgets (§6): a merge streams its documents into the split writer, but the built index and the bundle are still in memory, so its peak memory is about twice the output split (bounded by `max_merge_bytes`, 1 GiB); a hot build's work directory, which can hold gigabytes, is removed synchronously on the task's thread (M1.3 rows R32.3, 5.6).

## 6. Scheduling

- Tasks are **leases in meta** `(task_key, epoch, owner, deadline)`; workers pull tasks, renew leases, and are fenced by epoch.
- **Priorities:** link apply (freshness SLO) > segmenting > merges/compaction > hot builds > maintenance > GC.
- **Fair share per namespace** with weights; per-namespace caps on concurrent tasks and bytes/s to prevent noisy neighbors.
- **Autoscaling signals:** total link lag (seconds), compaction debt (bytes), queue age per priority.
- **Resource budgets:** CPU/memory per task class; object-store request budgets (PUT/GET rate) per node to stay under prefix limits.

**As built in M0 (`loams-worker`, M0.4):**
- A *task source* proposes task keys with work (the segmenter one per partition with a due WAL run, retention and GC one singleton each, link apply one per link, D30). Every node runs one `Worker`, which polls its sources (default every 1 s), orders the candidates by priority, then round-robin across namespaces within a priority, and starts what fits under `max_concurrent` (16) and `max_per_namespace` (4).
- A task runs under the metastore lease `task/<key>` (TTL 30 s) with a fence at the lease's epoch and a cancellation token. The worker renews every third of the TTL; a renewal that finds the lease expired re-takes it at the same epoch if nobody else took it (`ReacquireLease`), so a slow run keeps its fence; a lease someone else took cancels the run, and every metastore commit it attempts with its fence is rejected. Leases are released when a run ends; a crashed worker's leases expire.
- Weights, byte-rate caps, autoscaling signals and per-class resource budgets are not built yet.

## 7. Backpressure

- **Collection links (M1.3, D86):** each collection has a budget on its unapplied backlog, the records past `applied` (`max_unapplied_records`, default 1 000 000) and their log bytes (`max_unapplied_bytes`, default 128 MiB, at most half of `tail.max_bytes`). While the backlog is at either budget, collection writes are refused with HTTP 429 or gRPC `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` and `Retry-After` (estimated from the link's recent apply rate, 1–30 s); every write response reports the backlog (`Loams-Unapplied-Records`, `Loams-Unapplied-Bytes`). A bulk load may send `Loams-Backpressure: off` to write up to 4× the budget. M2 makes the budget a per-namespace and per-collection quota (D65) with metrics.
- Other links (M4 tables, M3 graphs) may configure a `max_lag` that throttles their source stream's producers the same way, or keep accepting (the log absorbs the backlog).
- Tail memory is bounded per object on query nodes; when exceeded, strong reads fall back to a range tail read directly from the log (bounded; `Unavailable` beyond the bound) — slower but correct (M1.2).
