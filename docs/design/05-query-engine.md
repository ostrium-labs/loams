# 05 — Query Engine

Status: **Approved** · 2026-09-22 · revised 2026-09-25 (frontends narrowed, D42/D44) · amended 2026-09-26 (M1.2 as built) · amended 2026-09-26 (turbopuffer gap analysis: `eventual` under backpressure, the performance block, ranking expressions, weighted concurrency, sharded collections; D86, D88, D91, D92, D95, D98)

All reads — native hybrid requests (including the graph `expand` stage), SQL over the native API and Flight SQL, ES `_search`, Qdrant `query` — compile to **Apache DataFusion** logical plans and execute on `query` nodes. DataFusion is embedded as a library; Loams adds catalogs, table providers, physical operators, optimizer rules and a distributed layer.

---

## 1. Catalog integration

| DataFusion concept | Loams mapping |
|---|---|
| `CatalogProvider` | Namespace |
| `SchemaProvider` | Object kind: `tables`, `collections`, `streams`, `graphs` (plus user schemas for tables) |
| `TableProvider` | `IcebergTable` (hot-tier aware), `CollectionProvider`, `StreamProvider` (offset/timestamp-bounded scans), `GraphVertexProvider`/`GraphEdgeProvider` |
| Table functions (UDTF) | `vector_search`, `text_search`, `hybrid_search`, `rrf` (reciprocal-rank fusion; Spice's names, D56; `rerank` reserved for M3), `graph_expand`, `graph_neighbors`, graph algorithms (`leiden`, `pagerank`, `wcc`) |

## 2. Custom physical operators

| Operator | Purpose | Inputs |
|---|---|---|
| `IcebergScanExec` | Pruned scan using T0 file index; chooses hot projection / T1 / cold per file group; merges T3 tail; applies DVs | Table snapshot + tail |
| `ProjectionScanExec` | Reads aggregate/sorted hot projections; sparse PK index + skip indexes | Hot projection |
| `TantivySearchExec` | BM25 top-k / boolean match over the manifest's splits plus the tail index, with global live-only BM25 statistics (§06 §3); returns `(_rowid, _pk, _score, _sort)` | Split set @ manifest + tail |
| `AnnExec` | Vector top-k; hot HNSW if present, else Lance IVF with nprobes/refine; merges tail brute-force | Collection @ manifest |
| `FilterBitmapExec` | Builds roaring bitmaps from Tantivy/Lance scalar indexes for pre-filtering | Filter predicate |
| `FusionExec` | Combines ranked lists: RRF, weighted score, DBSF (Qdrant-compatible) | ≥2 ranked inputs |
| `DocFetchExec` | Fetches documents/columns by stable row id from Lance (coalesced `take_rows`), and tail documents from the tail | Row ids |
| `ExpandExec` | 1–2 hop traversal over CSR/CSC + edge-delta overlay, with edge-type/property filters | Frontier vertex ids |
| `ShortestPathExec` | Bidirectional BFS | Two vertex sets |
| `StreamScanExec` | Scans stream segments by offset/time range, decodes RecordBatch → Arrow | Stream partitions |
| `TailMergeExec` | Unions durable results with tail results honoring upsert/delete semantics | Durable + tail |

All operators emit Arrow `RecordBatch` streams and report metrics (rows, bytes, cache hit ratios per layer, S3 GETs).

Row ids are one `RoaringTreemap` space for masks, bitmaps, fusion and fetch: durable rows carry their Lance stable row id (below 2^63), and tail documents carry `2^63 + seq`, a per-tail counter never reused within a process (M1.2 Ruling 7). As built in M1.2, aggregations and highlighting run beside `TantivySearchExec` over the same splits and tail, and `SparseExec` scores sparse vectors (§06 §6).

## 3. Optimizer rules

- **Index pushdown:** predicates on indexed columns become `FilterBitmapExec` inputs; `ORDER BY distance(v, q) LIMIT k` → `AnnExec`; `WHERE match(text, 'q') ORDER BY score LIMIT k` → `TantivySearchExec`. As built (M1.2 plan row 10.2), `CollectionProvider` pushes down only what keeps DataFusion's `Inexact` filter a superset: comparisons, `IN`, ranges and `IS [NOT] NULL` on keyword, integer, float, boolean, date and UUID fields with a literal of the column's type, and `NOT` only over exact, never-null operands; text and JSON predicates, and every predicate while a split older than the current schema version exists, are left to DataFusion.
- **Pre- vs post-filter selection** for ANN: cost-based on estimated filter selectivity (bitmap cardinality); highly selective → pre-filter (bitmap-restricted search / brute force on small sets); broad → post-filter with over-fetch. As built (M1.2, `AnnConfig`): a filter allowing at most `max(1 000, full_scan_threshold_kb · 1024 / (4 · dim))` durable rows is scored by brute force; one allowing at most 10 % of the durable rows prefilters the Lance index search; a broader one post-filters, asking for `k · 1.5 / selectivity` candidates and retrying once with 4× more, then prefilters. Index searches default to `nprobes = max(20, ⌈partitions / 16⌉)` and refine factor 20 (M1.2 plan row 6.1). Exact search (`exact`, a metric override, Manhattan, or no index) never uses an index, and every returned vector score is Loams’ own exact kernel (M1.2 Ruling 3).
- **Projection matching** for aggregates: a query whose grouping keys and aggregates a declared aggregate projection covers is rewritten to read it → `ProjectionScanExec`.
- **Late materialization:** retrieve `(_pk, row_addr, score)` first, fetch documents only for final top-k.
- **Dynamic filters** (DataFusion 54.1, M1.1) propagate join/top-k bounds into scans, including across distributed stage boundaries.

## 4. Hybrid retrieval (native API)

One request, one plan. `POST /v1/namespaces/{ns}/query` accepts this body (M1.2); consistency tokens are `v1:`-prefixed text:

```json
POST /v1/namespaces/acme/query
{
  "from": "collections.memories",
  "consistency": {"token": "v1:s7/p3@918273"},
  "retrieve": [
    {"vector": {"field": "embedding", "query": [0.12, …], "k": 100}},
    {"text":   {"field": "body", "query": "refund policy for enterprise", "k": 100}}
  ],
  "filter": {"and": [{"term": {"tenant": "t42"}}, {"range": {"ts": {"gte": "now-30d"}}}]},
  "fuse": {"method": "rrf", "k": 60},
  "expand": {"graph": "kg", "from_field": "entity_id", "hops": 2, "edge_types": ["MENTIONS", "RELATED_TO"], "limit": 50},
  "rerank": {"model": "endpoint:reranker-v2", "top_n": 20},
  "select": ["id", "body", "entity_id", "_score", "_neighbors"],
  "limit": 10
}
```

Plan: `FilterBitmapExec` → (`AnnExec` ‖ `TantivySearchExec`) → `FusionExec(RRF)` → `Limit(seeds)` (`expand.seeds`, default 10, §07 §5.2) → `ExpandExec(2 hops)` → `DocFetchExec` → optional `RerankExec` (UDF calling an external model endpoint; pluggable, off by default) → `Limit`.

`expand` and `rerank` are **M3 (D44)**: M1.2 refuses a body that carries either (`invalid_argument`).

The `expand` stage is the GraphRAG path (D44): vector/BM25 seeds → 1–2 hops over a mapped graph → rerank, in one planned query.

**Ranking expressions (M2, D91).** A request may add `rank`, an expression over `score`, numeric and date fields, constants, `saturate`, `decay` (gauss, exp, linear), `distance` (recency on dates), `if_match` (rank by filter) and `sum`/`max`/`min`/`product`/`weighted`. It runs after fusion, evaluated in f64 in a fixed order and rounded to f32, over D81's domains: every match with one text retriever and no vector retriever, else the fused candidates. ES `function_score` and Qdrant `formula` compile to it.

**Performance block (M1.6, D92).** Every native search response carries `performance`: `server_total_ms`, `queue_ms`, `planning_ms`, `execution_ms`, `manifest_version`, `tail_records`, `stale_records` (`eventual` only), `rows_scanned` per retriever, the H1 cache's hit and miss bytes and `hit_ratio`, and `object_store_requests` (the last two are lower bounds, since Lance reads on its own tasks). The SQL response carries the timings, and both carry `Server-Timing`. `POST …/collections/{c}/recall` (M1.7) measures ANN recall against the exact kernel on sampled stored vectors (D79, D92).

**Limits (D88).** `k`, `offset + limit`, retrievers, fusion depth, query clauses and nesting depth are bounded; the values and errors are on the published limits page (`docs/guides/limits.md`), rendered from the enforced table and tested.

The same retrieval is reachable from SQL. DataFusion 54 accepts only positional arguments for table functions in `FROM` (M1.2 Rulings 8 and 23), so the functions take them in Spice's order:

```sql
SELECT m._id, m.body, m._score
FROM hybrid_search('memories', 'embedding', [0.12, 0.34, 0.56], 'body', 'refund policy for enterprise', 100) AS m
WHERE m.tenant = 't42'
LIMIT 10;

SELECT _id, body, _score
FROM rrf(vector_search('memories', [0.12, 0.34, 0.56], 'embedding', 100),
         text_search('memories', 'refund policy for enterprise', 'body', 100))
LIMIT 10;
```

`vector_search(collection, query_vector [, field [, k [, filter_json [, exact]]]])` and `text_search(collection, text [, field [, k [, filter_json]]])` default `k` to 1 000; `rrf(retriever, retriever [, …] [, k [, limit]])` fuses nested calls of one collection with `k` 60; every function outputs `_score`. DataFusion folds the nested calls into literals before `rrf` plans them (M1.2 plan row 10.1), so `rrf` also accepts a retriever's JSON text, and `SELECT rrf(…)` in a projection returns that JSON. SQL search functions use Spice's names (D56); `rerank` is reserved for M3. The graph join (`graph_expand`) arrives with graphs in M3.

## 5. Consistency and snapshots

- At plan start, the coordinator resolves a **read snapshot** per referenced object: `(manifest_version | iceberg_snapshot_id, applied_offsets)`.
- If a consistency token is present, the required offsets define the tail range each object must merge: `(applied_offset, token_offset]`. Because the tail is read from the log, strong reads never wait for indexing.
- **Levels** (M1.2): `Strong` (the default; a linearizable high-watermark read, then the tail caught up to it), `AtLeast(token)`, `Eventual` and `Pinned { manifest_version, token }`. A pin holds nothing in the metastore: it reads its manifest plus a range tail up to its token for as long as the manifest is retained, then fails with `NotFound { kind: "pin" }` (M1.2 Ruling 14, A6).
- **Tail overlay rule** (M1.2 Ruling 1): a tail entry for key *k* in partition *p*, the latest op on *k* at offset *o*, overrides the durable state iff `o >= manifest.applied[p]`; entries below `applied` are already in the manifest and are dropped. One live tail therefore serves every manifest at or after its base. Reads the live tail cannot serve (a `Pinned` upper bound below its head, or an overflowed tail) build a *range tail* from the log over exactly `(applied, upper]`, cached per `(manifest, upper)`.
- `consistency: "eventual"` reads the durable state plus whatever live tail the node already holds (lowest latency; bounded staleness = link lag). It never builds a range tail, so it reads at most `tail.max_bytes` of the backlog, and it reports the records it did not see in `performance.stale_records` (D86, amending D77).
- **Backpressure keeps strong reads on the live tail** (D86): a collection refuses writes (429, `Retry-After`) while its unapplied backlog is at its budget, and the budget is at most half of `tail.max_bytes`, so a strong read does not need a range tail unless a bulk load overrode the budget.
- All operators within one query use the same snapshot ⇒ repeatable results inside a query.

## 6. Distributed execution

- **Single-node** execution is the default for point/top-k queries routed to the owning node.
- **Distributed** execution via **datafusion-distributed** (Arrow Flight between stages) for large scans, joins and aggregations: the coordinator splits file groups/split groups/vertex ranges by ownership (hot-tier affinity) and streams partial results.
- Ballista is not used (batch/shuffle-to-disk oriented).
- Top-k across shards: two-phase (local top-k′ → global merge) with k′ = k × safety factor for ANN.
- **Sharded collections (M2.x, D95):** a query fans out to every shard's owner at one token; BM25 statistics are gathered from every shard and summed before any shard scores (D78 holds per collection), and vector scores stay exact (D79), so results do not depend on the shard count.

## 7. Resource management

- Per-query memory pools (DataFusion `MemoryPool`) with per-namespace limits; spill to NVMe.
- Admission control and priority classes: `interactive` (search/vector/graph), `analytical` (large scans), `background` (worker-internal). Interactive preempts analytical on shared nodes; large deployments separate pools.
- Timeouts and cancellation propagate across distributed stages.
- **Per-collection concurrency (M2, D98):** a semaphore per collection on its owner, 16 slots by default; text, filter and ANN queries take 1 slot, exact or brute-force vector queries 2, aggregations, `group_by` and SQL scans 4. A query waits up to 800 ms for its slots, then gets 429 with `Retry-After: 1`.

## 8. Frontends

| Frontend | Parser/mapping | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Native REST/gRPC | Hybrid request (§4) → logical plan; SQL endpoint with DataFusion SQL + Loams UDTFs | Primary surface; hybrid, graph `expand` and SQL |
| Arrow Flight SQL (ADBC) | DataFusion SQL + Loams UDTFs | Queries, and `DoPut` bulk ingest into collections and streams (D49) |
| ES Query DSL | Quickwit-derived DSL → logical plan | §06 |
| Qdrant query API | Direct mapping → logical plan | §06 |

Graph queries have no language frontend: traversal runs as `ExpandExec` and `ShortestPathExec`, reached through the SQL table functions (§1) and the hybrid `expand` stage (§4) (D44).

**Arrow Flight SQL** is a core surface from M1.2 (D49): high-throughput result transfer (Python/pandas/Polars, BI via ADBC) and zero-copy bulk ingest; the ADBC Flight SQL drivers (Python and Go) are an M1 exit gate.

As built (M1.2):
- **Listener:** `native.flight_sql` (`--flight-sql-listen`; default `0.0.0.0:8082`, `127.0.0.1:8082` for `loams dev`; `--no-flight-sql` turns it off).
- **Queries:** read-only SQL (DDL, DML and statements are refused on every served surface), the same planner as the REST `…/sql` endpoint. The namespace is the request metadata `loams-namespace` (default `default`); `loams-consistency-token` reads `AtLeast` that token, else `Strong`. `GetCatalogs` lists namespaces, `GetDbSchemas`/`GetTables` list collections (not aliases, M1.2 plan row 12.2).
- **`DoPut` bulk ingest** into collections and streams (D49): a PATH descriptor `["collections", c]`, `["streams", s]` or `["streams", s, p]` answers one `PutAck` per record batch (`{batch, rows, token, offsets}`, the token covering the whole put so far); `CommandStatementIngest` serves ADBC's `adbc_ingest` (`create`, `append` and `create_append`; `replace` is refused) and answers the row count. Collection columns: `_id` (unsigned integers, strings, or 16-byte UUIDs; `loams-id-type: u64|uuid`, as field or request metadata, types string keys), `_source` (one JSON object, verbatim), one column per dense vector (`FixedSizeList<Float32, dim>`; `_vector` for the unnamed vector, and a collection created by ingest names such a column's vector `""`, M1.2 plan row 13.2) or sparse vector (`Struct<indices, values>`), `_seq_no`/`_partition`/`_score` ignored, and, without `_source`, any other column as a top-level source key. Stream columns: `key`, `value`, `headers`, `timestamp`, `partition`. Batches are written in chunks of 10 000 rows through the native write path, one chunk in flight, each whole or not at all.
- **Scan plans:** pinned reads of a scan plan (D53) use the metadata `loams-pin-manifest` with `loams-consistency-token`; §17 §3.7 describes the scan plan as built.
