# CN1 — The Connector Registry and the ★ Connectors Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans. Execute task by task, test first. Each task lists the interfaces it must produce and the tests that must exist and pass before it is done. Where this plan gives exact values (names, paths, event types, constants), use them verbatim. The code is not pre-written in this plan (M0.3 Ruling 1).

> **Status: In progress** (2026-10-04). Track CN, after FL1 (it needs the Fabric stack, `ingest` and the plugins); it can run beside FL2. Branches `cn1-t<N>`, stacked; PRs target `main`. CN1 adds the crate `loams-flow` to the `fabric/` workspace, the `flow` role of `loams-fabric`, a Java service `loams-connect` (Task 12) and registry data under `connectors/`. It changes no engine code. **Tasks 1 and 2 are in review on `cn1-t1-registry`**: the registry is 203 manifests and 203 instance-config schemas, `matrix.py --check` renders Appendix A from the CSV byte-for-byte, and `camel_catalog.py --check` reports 0 errors and 0 cells needing a doc edit against `apache/camel` at tag `camel-4.22.1` (kestra_catalog: 0 findings). Three Appendix A Camel cells were corrected as a result — Redshift to `aws2-redshift-data`, Kubernetes to three concrete `kubernetes-*` schemes, SMTP/IMAP to `smtp`/`imaps`; Tasks 0–2's dependency measurements are in [`cn1-dependency-spike.md`](cn1-dependency-spike.md) and their rulings in the table at the end.

**Goal:** Ship [§33](../design/33-connectors.md)'s registry, capability schema and the 21 ★ connectors of §33 §8:
- `loams.flow.v1` connector protos, the manifest loader and validator, and the 200-connector registry generated from one catalog file, with drift checks against the Camel and Kestra catalogs;
- connector instances, the `FlowService` API, the runtime supervisors (native, Iggy connectors runtime, Camel `loams-connect`, Debezium Server) and the contract-test kit;
- the ★ connectors (the précis' set; task order below is the build order, since HTTP and the formats are reused by the rest), each with a manifest, contract tests against a real service and docs;
- the CN1 gate of §33 §9.

**Architecture:**
- **`loams-flow`** holds the registry, instance validation, the runtime supervisors and the native connectors (`loams_flow::connectors::<id>`). `loams-fabric flow` serves `FlowService` over connect-rust on `127.0.0.1:7731` (loopback, D111) and supervises instances. One `flow` process supervises everything in CN1; leases for several `flow` processes come in FL3.
- **State** is the Fabric's system table `_fabric.flow_objects` (Fluss PK table, LastRow; key `(namespace BIGINT, kind STRING, name STRING)`; columns `version BIGINT, spec BYTES (postcard), updated TIMESTAMP_LTZ(3)`), as §32 D337 states. Native source positions are in `_fabric.flow_positions` (key `(namespace, instance, partition_key STRING)`, value `position BYTES`).
- **Every source writes to the Fabric** through `loams-fabric ingest`'s core (in-process for native connectors, HTTP for Debezium Server) or directly to Iggy with the envelope of FL1 Task 2; **every sink reads from Iggy** (native connectors as Iggy consumer groups; Iggy plugins inside the connectors runtime; Camel through `camel-iggy`).
- **Secrets** come from a `SecretStore` trait: `FileSecretStore` (dev, `deploy/fabric/secrets/`, mode 0600) in CN1; Dapr's secrets building block through `loams-dapr` (D189) when §24's F1 lands.

**Tech Stack:**
- Rust 1.97.1, the `fabric/` workspace. New dependencies (Task 0 verifies versions, licences, build cost): `jsonschema` 0.30+ (MIT), `serde_yaml_ng` or `serde_norway` (MIT/Apache; Task 0 picks a maintained YAML crate), `rdkafka` 0.39 with `cmake-build` and `ssl-vendored` (MIT; librdkafka BSD-2-Clause), `tokio-postgres` 0.7 (MIT/Apache), `mysql_async` 0.37 (MIT/Apache), `object_store` 0.14 (Apache-2.0), `iceberg` 0.10 (Apache-2.0), `parquet` 59, `arrow-ipc`/`arrow-flight` 59, `apache-avro` 0.22 (Apache-2.0), `adbc_core` and `adbc_driver_manager` 0.24 (Apache-2.0), `clickhouse` 0.15 (Apache-2.0), `aws-sdk-kinesis` 1.x (Apache-2.0), `redis` 1.7 (BSD-3-Clause), `reqwest` 0.12, `hmac`, `sha2`, `opentelemetry-proto` (Apache-2.0) for OTLP decoding.
- Services for tests (added to `deploy/fabric/compose.yaml` under profile `connectors`, pinned by digest): Apache Kafka 4.x in KRaft mode (Apache-2.0), Postgres 17 with `wal_level=logical`, MySQL 8.4 with row binlog, Debezium Server 3.7.0.Final, Elasticsearch-compatible target (Loams’ own ES gateway from `loams dev`, plus OpenSearch 3.x (Apache-2.0) for a third-party check), ClickHouse server (the FL2 reference image), Redis-compatible Valkey 8 (BSD-3-Clause), floci 2.1.0 (MIT, D60) for Kinesis and S3 events, RustFS (S3), Lakekeeper.
- ADBC drivers: Snowflake and BigQuery drivers (Apache-2.0, `adbc-drivers/*`), Postgres, SQLite, DuckDB and Flight SQL drivers (Apache Arrow ADBC); shipped as shared libraries pinned by SHA-256 (Q349).
- Java (Task 12 only, **run, never written**): the `apache/camel` 4.22.x runtime image or Camel JBang (`camel run *.yaml`), JDK 21 inside it. **Java is deferred (owner, 2026-10-01): Loams writes no Java in CN1** — no Maven project, no Loams processor, no Java SDK; routes are YAML, transforms use Camel's built-in `jq`/`jsonata` languages and `camel-cloudevents`.
- Names: published packages `loams-*` (crates.io, PyPI) and `@loams/*` (npm); CloudEvents types `io.loams.dev.<domain>.<name>.v1` (owner rulings, 2026-10-01).

**Spec:**
- [`docs/design/33-connectors.md`](../design/33-connectors.md): all of it.
- [`docs/design/32-loams-flow-fabric-house.md`](../design/32-loams-flow-fabric-house.md): §5.4 (envelope), §5.5 (adapters), §5.7 (bridges), §6 (Flow).
- [FL1](2026-10-01-fl1-fabric-foundation.md) as built: `loams-fabric-envelope`, `loams-fabric-ingest`, provisioning, `TableSpec`, the plugins.
- [`docs/design/13-decision-log.md`](../design/13-decision-log.md): D11, D60, D111, D189, D210; D352–D359 once merged.

## Global Constraints

- **Buy first** (§33 D354): before writing a native connector, the task checks whether the Iggy plugin or the Camel component covers the declared capabilities; a native one is written only where §33 §8 says so.
- **Every manifest validates** against `connectors/schema/connector.schema.json`, and every declared capability of a ★ connector has a contract test (§33 D353 rule 3). CI fails otherwise.
- **Licence gate** (§33 D359): `connectors/licences.toml` lists every runtime component and driver with its SPDX id; CI refuses AGPL, BSL, SSPL, ELv2, `NOASSERTION` and unknown ids for anything in the image or the default compose.
- **No secret in a manifest, an instance spec, a rendered config, a log line or an error.** Instances reference secrets by name; rendered configs for Iggy, Camel and Debezium read them from files mounted at run time. A test greps every rendered config and captured log for the test secrets' values (Task 3).
- **Loopback only (D111)** for `FlowService` and every connector endpoint Loams serves (webhooks, OTLP).
- **Tests skip without services**, as FL1 (`loams_fabric_testing::stack()`, plus `LOAMS_CONNECTORS_STACK` for the `connectors` profile).
- **The build machine.** `rdkafka`'s static librdkafka build is the heaviest addition (Task 0 measures); it is behind the feature `kafka` (on in CI and release, off by default for local builds of other tasks).
- **Commit areas:** `flow`, `connectors`, `connect` (YAML routes), `ci`, `docs`.

## Rulings made while writing this plan

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The registry is generated from one CSV**, `connectors/registry/catalog.csv` (the columns of §33 Appendix A plus `id`, `category`, `runtime`, `ref`, `status`); per-connector YAML manifests for ★ connectors are hand-written and checked against the CSV; P2/P3 manifests are generated stubs with `status: planned` | One source for 200 rows; hand-written detail where it matters | A CSV edit can disagree with a hand-written manifest; the drift test catches it |
| 2 | **Event types**: `io.loams.dev.flow.<connector-id>.<event>.v1` with these events: Kafka `record`, Kinesis `record`, Redis `stream-entry`, S3 `object` and `object-deleted`, Iceberg `rows`, Postgres/MySQL batch `rows`, CDC `change` (with `loamsop`), ADBC `rows`, HTTP poll `response-item`, webhook `delivery`, OTLP `log`, `span`, `metric` | One naming rule (§33 D355) | Renaming later is a manifest major bump |
| 3 | **Batch-of-rows events** carry Arrow IPC stream bytes (`datacontenttype: application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream`), 65 536 rows each by default (`batch_rows`), one event per batch; their `id` is `"<run-id>/<partition>/<first-row>-<last-row>"` with `run-id` defined exactly as in §33 §6 (SHA-256 of instance, query or object and as-of position), so it is stable across retries and re-reads at the same as-of position | Bulk stays columnar end to end (§33 D356); `fluss_sink` appends Arrow batches without per-row decoding (FL1 Task 8 gains an Arrow fast path in this plan's Task 5) | Iggy's message size limit caps batch bytes; Task 0 records the limit and `batch_bytes` (default 8 MiB) splits batches |
| 4 | **Native source positions commit after the Fabric acknowledges** the batch (FL1's `ingest` core answers with offsets) | At-least-once with re-delivery recognisable by id (§33 §6) | None |
| 5 | **Native sinks are Iggy consumer groups** named `flow-<instance>`, committing offsets after the sink acknowledges | Same model as the Iggy plugins | None |
| 6 | **Debezium Server runs one container per CDC instance** with the HTTP sink to `loams-fabric ingest` (`debezium.sink.type=http`, CloudEvents structured format through Debezium's CloudEvents converter, verify the 3.7 property names in Task 0), offsets and schema history in files on a volume | Unmodified Debezium; one failure domain per source database | Many containers for many sources; Q351's Iggy `postgres_source` for small Postgres sources |
| 7 | **`loams-connect` is the unmodified Camel runtime in Main mode** (not Quarkus) in CN1, with YAML-DSL routes loaded from a mounted directory and reloaded on change; no Loams Java (Java deferred, owner 2026-10-01) | Least moving parts; Quarkus native is Q352 for CN2 | JVM start time and memory; measured in Task 12 |
| 8 | **JDBC drivers are not shipped**: `loams-connect` loads drivers from a mounted directory; the PostgreSQL (BSD-2-Clause) and MariaDB Connector/J (LGPL-2.1-or-later, loaded, not modified) drivers are documented; MySQL Connector/J (GPL-2.0 with FOSS exception) is the user's choice | Keeps the image's licence set clean (D359) | One more step for users of JDBC |
| 9 | **ADBC drivers load by path from an allowlist** in the instance's namespace config (`adbc.drivers = ["snowflake", "bigquery", …]`) and only from `/opt/loams/adbc/<name>/<version>/` with a SHA-256 check | A driver is native code in Loams’ process | A compromised driver image still runs in-process; Q349 |

## Carried in

FL1's rulings during execution, its stack, `ingest` core (`loams_fabric_ingest::{IngestCore, append_events}` as built) and the plugins at their pinned fork revisions.

## Review Focus

1. **Capabilities are proven, not claimed**: each ★ manifest's capabilities against its contract tests. Test: Task 3 (`every_declared_capability_has_a_test`).
2. **No loss across restarts** of each runtime, and duplicates only within the declared delivery. Tests: each connector task's `kill_restart_*`.
3. **Secrets never leak**. Test: Task 3 (`no_secret_in_rendered_configs_or_logs`).
4. **Bulk stays columnar** (no per-row JSON on ADBC, Parquet, Iceberg and Postgres batch paths). Test: Task 11 (`bulk_path_has_no_row_decode`, a counter in `loams-fabric-envelope` that must stay 0).
5. **Licence gate**. Test: Task 2 (`licence_gate_refuses_flagged`).

### Task 0: Reconcile and measure

**Files:** read FL1 as built; write `docs/plans/cn1-dependency-spike.md`; fill "Rulings made during execution".

**Checks:** the versions and licences of every dependency in Tech Stack (crates.io, SPDX); `rdkafka` static build time and binary size delta (one measured build each way); ADBC driver availability per platform (Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, SQLite, DuckDB, Flight SQL), their download sources and SHA-256s, and a load test of each through `adbc_driver_manager` 0.24 with arrow 59; Debezium Server 3.7 image, the HTTP sink and CloudEvents converter properties, and whether its offset store can be other than a file; the Camel version to pin (latest 4.x LTS or 4.22.x; record Camel's LTS list), `camel-iggy`'s status and its Iggy client version against Iggy 0.9.0; the Iggy plugin list at FL1's pinned revision and each plugin's config keys for the ★ sinks used (`elasticsearch_sink`, `clickhouse_sink`, `postgres_sink`, `s3_sink`, `iceberg_sink`, `http_sink`); Iggy's maximum message and batch sizes (Ruling 3); the Kestra plugin list and Camel catalog JSON locations for the drift scripts.

**Commit:** `docs: reconcile CN1 with FL1 and record the connector dependency spike`.

### Task 1: Protos, manifests and validation

**Files:** `fabric/proto/loams/flow/v1/{connector.proto,instance.proto}`, `connectors/schema/connector.schema.json`, `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/{lib.rs,manifest.rs,validate.rs,registry.rs}`, `fabric/crates/loams-flow/tests/{registry.rs,validate.rs}`.

**Produces:**

```rust
pub struct ConnectorSpec { pub id: String, pub name: String, pub spec_version: semver::Version, pub category: Category,
                           pub priority: Priority, pub starred: bool, pub status: Status, pub runtime: RuntimeRef,
                           pub licence: Licence, pub capabilities: Capabilities, pub auth: Vec<AuthMethod>,
                           pub config_schema: serde_json::Value, pub secrets: Vec<String>, pub envelope: EnvelopeDecl,
                           pub limits: Limits, pub conformance: Vec<Suite>, pub docs: Option<String> }
pub struct Capabilities { pub source: Option<SourceCaps>, pub sink: Option<SinkCaps>, pub delivery: Delivery,
                          pub ordering: Ordering, pub formats: Vec<Format>, pub schema: SchemaCaps, pub bulk: BulkCaps, pub backpressure: Backpressure }
pub struct SourceCaps { pub streaming: bool, pub batch: bool, pub cdc: bool, pub webhook: bool, pub resumable: bool, pub position: String }
pub struct SinkCaps { pub streaming: bool, pub batch: bool, pub transactional: bool, pub upsert: bool, pub delete: bool, pub idempotent: bool }
pub enum RuntimeRef { Native { module: String }, Iggy { plugin: String }, Camel { scheme: String }, Debezium { connector_class: String }, OpenApi { spec: String } }
pub struct Registry { /* by id, by category */ }
impl Registry { pub fn load(dir: &Path) -> Result<Self, RegistryError>; pub fn get(&self, id: &str) -> Option<&ConnectorSpec>; pub fn list(&self, filter: &Filter) -> Vec<&ConnectorSpec>; }
pub fn validate_manifest(m: &serde_json::Value) -> Result<ConnectorSpec, Vec<ManifestError>>;   // JSON Schema + semantic rules
pub fn check_use(spec: &ConnectorSpec, uses: &Uses) -> Result<(), CapabilityError>;              // §33 D353 rule 1
pub struct CapabilityError { pub connector: String, pub capability: String, pub spec_version: String }
```

**Semantic rules** beyond the JSON Schema: a sink with `upsert` declares a key in its config schema; `cdc: true` implies `source.streaming` and a `position`; `delivery.sink = exactly_once` requires `transactional` or `idempotent`; `starred` implies `priority = P1`; every auth method is in the enum of §33 Appendix A's legend; every secret name appears in the config schema with `"writeOnly": true`.

**Tests:** `schema_validates_kafka_example` (§33 §4's YAML verbatim); `semantic_rules_each_refuse` (one case per rule); `check_use_refuses_undeclared` (cdc on a polling source, upsert on an append sink, exactly-once on an at-least-once sink); `proto_and_yaml_agree` (round-trip through the protobuf form).

**Commit:** `flow: add connector manifests, their schema and validation`.

### Task 2: The registry data, the generator and the drift checks

**Files:** `connectors/registry/catalog.csv`, `connectors/registry/*.yaml`, `connectors/licences.toml`, `scripts/connectors/{gen_registry.sh,camel_catalog.py,kestra_catalog.py,matrix.py}`, `fabric/crates/loams-fabric/src/main.rs` (`loams-fabric connectors gen|list|describe|validate`), `fabric/crates/loams-flow/tests/registry.rs`.

**Semantics:** `catalog.csv` holds §33 Appendix A's 200 rows plus the extra columns of Ruling 1. `connectors gen` writes stub manifests for rows without a hand-written one, and renders Appendix A's Markdown tables (`scripts/connectors/matrix.py --check` compares them with `docs/design/33-connectors.md`'s appendix). `camel_catalog.py` reads `camel-catalog` 4.22.x's component JSON (Maven artifact, Apache-2.0) and checks every Camel cell names a real component and that its producer/consumer support agrees with Sink/Source; `kestra_catalog.py` checks Kestra cells against the plugin repository list; both run weekly and on demand, not on every PR (network). The licence gate reads `licences.toml` and each manifest's `licence`.

**Tests:** `registry_has_200_entries_and_21_starred`; `csv_and_manifests_agree`; `appendix_matches_csv`; `licence_gate_refuses_flagged` (fixtures with AGPL, BSL, ELv2, NOASSERTION); `connectors_cli_list_and_describe`.

**Commit:** `connectors: generate the 200-connector registry and its drift checks`.

### Task 3: Instances, `FlowService`, runtimes, secrets and the contract-test kit

**Files:** `fabric/proto/loams/flow/v1/flow.proto`, `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/{instance.rs,store.rs,secrets.rs,service.rs,runtime/*.rs}`, `fabric/crates/loams-flow-conformance/**`, `fabric/crates/loams-flow/tests/{secrets.rs,runtime.rs}`.

**Produces:**

```rust
pub struct Instance { pub namespace: u64, pub name: String, pub connector: String, pub connector_major: u64,
                      pub config: serde_json::Value, pub secrets: BTreeMap<String, SecretRef>, pub direction: Direction,
                      pub fabric: FabricBinding /* topic or table to write (source) or consume (sink) */, pub enabled: bool }
pub trait SecretStore: Send + Sync { async fn resolve(&self, ns: u64, r: &SecretRef) -> Result<Secret, SecretError>; }
pub struct Secret(zeroize::Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>);                       // Debug prints "<redacted>"
#[async_trait] pub trait ConnectorRuntime: Send + Sync {
    fn kind(&self) -> RuntimeKind;
    async fn start(&self, inst: &Instance, spec: &ConnectorSpec) -> Result<RunHandle, RuntimeError>;
    async fn stop(&self, h: RunHandle, grace: Duration) -> Result<(), RuntimeError>;
    async fn status(&self, h: &RunHandle) -> RunStatus;              // Running { lag, last_error } | Stopped | Failed
}
// FlowService (connect-rust, 127.0.0.1:7731): ListConnectors, DescribeConnector, CreateInstance, UpdateInstance,
// ValidateInstance, DeleteInstance, StartInstance, StopInstance, InstanceStatus.
// loams-flow-conformance:
pub async fn contract(spec: &ConnectorSpec, harness: &dyn ConnectorHarness) -> SuiteResult;   // one check per declared capability
pub trait ConnectorHarness { /* seed the external system, read it back, kill and restart its runtime */ }
```

**Semantics:** instances are validated against the manifest's config schema and `check_use`; secrets are resolved only inside the runtime at start; runtimes: `NativeRuntime` runs the connector's `Source`/`Sink` impl (traits below) on tokio; `IggyRuntime` renders a connectors-runtime TOML per instance (secrets as file paths), runs `iggy-connectors` as a child process with a health probe on its HTTP API (verify the runtime's API), restarts with backoff; `CamelRuntime` writes a YAML route file into `loams-connect`'s watched directory (Task 12); `DebeziumRuntime` renders `application.properties` and runs a Debezium Server container through the local Docker API in dev (Kubernetes Deployment rendering is FL3's). Native connector traits:

```rust
#[async_trait] pub trait Source: Send { async fn open(&mut self, pos: Option<Position>) -> Result<(), ConnectorError>;
                                        async fn next(&mut self) -> Result<Option<SourceBatch>, ConnectorError>;
                                        async fn committed(&mut self, upto: &Position) -> Result<(), ConnectorError>; }
#[async_trait] pub trait Sink: Send { async fn write(&mut self, events: &[CloudEvent]) -> Result<SinkAck, ConnectorError>;
                                      async fn write_arrow(&mut self, batch: RecordBatch) -> Result<SinkAck, ConnectorError> { /* default: unsupported */ } }
pub struct SourceBatch { pub events: Vec<CloudEvent>, pub position: Position }
```

**Tests:** `instance_validation_uses_manifest`; `instance_versions_increment`; `no_secret_in_rendered_configs_or_logs` (every runtime renders a config with known test secrets; a grep over rendered files and captured logs finds none); `secret_debug_is_redacted`; `iggy_runtime_restarts_crashed_child`; `every_declared_capability_has_a_test` (for each ★ manifest, the conformance kit has a check registered for each declared capability; fails on a missing one).

**Commit:** `flow: add instances, FlowService, runtime supervisors and the contract-test kit`.

### Task 4: HTTP/REST ★ and Webhooks ★

**Files:** `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/connectors/{http.rs,webhook.rs}`, `connectors/registry/{http,webhooks}.yaml`, `connectors/schemas/{http,webhooks}.config.json`, `fabric/crates/loams-flow/tests/{http.rs,webhook.rs}`, `docs/guides/connectors/{http,webhooks}.md`.

**Semantics:** **HTTP sink**: POST each event in CloudEvents binary mode (or structured, by config) with `Idempotency-Key: <ce_id>`, retries with exponential backoff (100 ms → 30 s, 10 attempts) on 408/425/429/5xx and connection errors, honouring `Retry-After`; 4xx other than those → DLQ. **HTTP polling source**: a request template, a cursor extracted with a JSON pointer (or a `Link` header), an items pointer, one event per item with `id` = `"<url>#<item key>"` and the cursor as the position; poll interval and rate limit from config. **Webhooks source**: routes `POST /v1/namespaces/{ns}/fabric/webhooks/{instance}` on `ingest`'s listener; verification schemes `hmac-sha256` (header and secret configurable), `github` (`X-Hub-Signature-256`), `stripe` (`Stripe-Signature` with tolerance 300 s), `slack` (`X-Slack-Signature` + timestamp), `shopify` (`X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256`); a failed signature → 401 and a counter; each delivery becomes one CloudEvent (`type io.loams.dev.flow.webhooks.delivery.v1`, `id` the provider's delivery id header where one exists, else SHA-256 of the body and timestamp).

**Tests:** `http_sink_retries_and_dedupe_header`; `http_sink_4xx_goes_to_dlq`; `http_poll_follows_cursor_and_resumes`; `webhook_each_scheme_verifies` (fixtures from each provider's docs); `webhook_bad_signature_is_401`; `webhook_replay_is_deduplicated` (same delivery id twice → one event); contract suites for both manifests.

**Commit:** `connectors: HTTP sink, HTTP polling source and signed webhooks`.

### Task 5: Parquet ★, Avro ★ and Arrow IPC/Flight ★

**Files:** `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/formats/*.rs`, `connectors/registry/{parquet,avro,arrow}.yaml`, `fabric/crates/loams-flow/tests/formats.rs`; in `dina-kar/iggy` `loams/fluss-sink`: an Arrow fast path (`datacontenttype = application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream` events appended as batches without per-row decoding).

**Semantics:** `formats::decode(format, bytes, schema) -> RecordBatch stream` and `encode(format, batch) -> bytes` for Parquet (files and row groups), Avro (object container files, single-object encoding, and the Confluent wire format with a registry client stub until Q344), Arrow IPC stream and file, and Flight (`DoGet` source with a ticket, `DoPut` sink, including against Loams’ Flight SQL endpoint for collections and streams). Schema mapping Avro ↔ Arrow per the Arrow project's rules (logical types: timestamp-millis/micros, date, decimal, uuid).

**Tests:** `parquet_roundtrip_all_types`; `avro_container_and_confluent_framing`; `avro_logical_types_map`; `arrow_ipc_roundtrip`; `flight_doget_from_loams` (a `loams dev` collection scanned through Flight into Arrow events); `fluss_sink_arrow_fast_path` (in the fork's tests and ours: the decode counter stays 0).

**Commit:** `connectors: Parquet, Avro and Arrow codecs with a columnar fast path`.

### Task 6: Kafka ★

**Files:** `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/connectors/kafka.rs`, `connectors/registry/kafka.yaml`, `connectors/schemas/kafka.config.json`, `fabric/crates/loams-flow/tests/kafka.rs`, `docs/guides/connectors/kafka.md`.

**Semantics:** **source**: an `rdkafka` `StreamConsumer` in group `loams-<ns>-<instance>`, `enable.auto.commit=false`; each record → one CloudEvent (records that already carry valid `ce_` headers are passed through as those events, D270's rule 1; others get `type io.loams.dev.flow.kafka.record.v1`, `id` `"<topic>/<partition>/<offset>"`, `subject` the key, headers as `kafkaheader_<name>` extensions); offsets committed after the Fabric acknowledges (Ruling 4); partitions map to Iggy partitions by key hash (Kafka's murmur2, so per-key order is kept). **sink**: an idempotent producer (`enable.idempotence=true`, `acks=all`), the CloudEvents Kafka binary layout (D270), key = `partitionkey` else `subject`; Avro values with a schema registry when configured. Auth: SASL PLAIN/SCRAM over TLS, mTLS, MSK IAM (verify `rdkafka`'s OAUTHBEARER callback route for MSK IAM in Task 0; else documented as Camel-only).

**Tests:** `source_reads_all_partitions_in_order_per_key`; `source_resumes_from_committed_offsets`; `ce_headers_pass_through`; `sink_idempotent_on_retry`; `sink_ce_binary_layout_matches_d270`; `kill_restart_source_no_loss`; `sasl_scram_and_mtls`; contract suite.

**Commit:** `connectors: Kafka source and idempotent sink`.

### Task 7: PostgreSQL ★ and MySQL ★ (batch and upsert)

**Files:** `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/connectors/{postgres.rs,mysql.rs}`, `connectors/registry/{postgresql,mysql}.yaml`, `fabric/crates/loams-flow/tests/{postgres.rs,mysql.rs}`, docs.

**Semantics:** **Postgres batch source**: a snapshot (`REPEATABLE READ`, exported snapshot shared by parallel workers), table split by primary-key ranges into `partitions` (default 8) workers, each `COPY (SELECT … WHERE pk >= $1 AND pk < $2) TO STDOUT (FORMAT binary)` decoded into Arrow batches (Ruling 3); incremental mode by a `cursor_column` high-water mark. **Postgres sink**: upsert batches through a temporary table and `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (key) DO UPDATE` (or `COPY` for append), in one transaction per batch, so a batch is atomic; deletes for `loamsop = d`. Streaming sinks may instead use Iggy's `postgres_sink` (manifest `runtime` alternative recorded). **MySQL**: the same with chunked `SELECT … WHERE pk > ? ORDER BY pk LIMIT n` and `INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`. Auth: password, TLS (verify-full), AWS RDS IAM tokens.

**Tests:** `pg_parallel_snapshot_is_consistent` (concurrent writes during the read do not appear); `pg_incremental_cursor`; `pg_upsert_batch_atomic`; `pg_delete_on_loamsop_d`; `mysql_chunked_read_and_upsert`; `bulk_path_has_no_row_decode` (Postgres batch path); `kill_restart_*`; contract suites.

**Commit:** `connectors: Postgres and MySQL batch sources and upsert sinks`.

### Task 8: Debezium-Postgres ★ and Debezium-MySQL ★ (CDC)

**Files:** `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/connectors/cdc.rs`, `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/runtime/debezium.rs`, `connectors/registry/{debezium-postgres,debezium-mysql}.yaml`, `deploy/fabric/connectors/debezium/*.properties.tmpl`, `fabric/crates/loams-flow/tests/cdc.rs`, `docs/guides/connectors/cdc.md`.

**Semantics (§33 D357, §7):** an instance renders Debezium Server's properties (connector class, slot and publication names `loams_<instance>`, `snapshot.mode=initial`, incremental snapshots through a signal table, the HTTP sink URL `http://<ingest>/v1/namespaces/{ns}/fabric/topics/{topic}/events`, the CloudEvents structured format) and starts the container (Ruling 6). `ingest` receives Debezium's CloudEvents; `cdc.rs` adds `loamsop` (from `op`) and `loamslsn` (Postgres `lsn` / MySQL `file:pos` + `gtid` when present) as extensions in `ingest`'s CDC mode (the route option `cdc = debezium`). A route template creates `<table>_current` (Fluss PK, Versioned on `_loams_lsn_order`, a monotonic numeric derived from the LSN or binlog position) and `<table>_history` (Fluss Log). Monitoring: slot lag (`pg_replication_slots` polled by the flow process with a read-only role), Debezium's metrics endpoint scraped; `flow_cdc_slot_lag_bytes` and `flow_cdc_behind_ms` gauges; an alert rule example.

**Tests:** `pg_cdc_inserts_updates_deletes_converge` (the `_current` table equals the source table after a random workload of 10 000 operations); `mysql_cdc_converges`; `debezium_restart_resumes_without_loss`; `incremental_snapshot_emits_r`; `ddl_add_column_evolves_table`; `incompatible_ddl_pauses_with_error`; `slot_lag_metric_moves`; contract suites.

**Commit:** `connectors: Postgres and MySQL CDC through Debezium Server`.

### Task 9: S3 ★ and Iceberg ★

**Files:** `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/connectors/{s3.rs,iceberg.rs}`, `connectors/registry/{s3,iceberg}.yaml`, `deploy/fabric/connectors/iggy/{s3_sink,iceberg_sink}.toml.tmpl`, tests, docs.

**Semantics:** **S3 source**: `object_store` listing under a prefix with a high-water key (lexicographic) and, optionally, S3 event notifications through SQS (floci in CI) for low latency; per object either one `object` event (metadata, no data) or decoded rows (Parquet, CSV, NDJSON, Avro by suffix or config) as Arrow batch events; position = the last fully emitted key. **S3 sink**: Iggy's `s3_sink` (config rendered) for raw events; a native Parquet writer for Arrow batch events, files rolled by size (128 MiB) or time (5 min). **Iceberg source**: iceberg-rust incremental scans between snapshots (append-only snapshots; overwrite snapshots are re-scanned whole and flagged), Arrow batch events, position = the last snapshot id. **Iceberg sink**: for Fabric tables, Fluss tiering (nothing to run); for raw topics, Iggy's `iceberg_sink` with Lakekeeper.

**Tests:** `s3_list_resumes_at_high_water_key`; `s3_notifications_low_latency` (floci SQS); `s3_parquet_objects_as_arrow_batches`; `s3_sink_rolls_files`; `iceberg_incremental_append_snapshots`; `iceberg_overwrite_rescans_and_flags`; `kill_restart_*`; contract suites.

**Commit:** `connectors: S3 and Iceberg sources and sinks`.

### Task 10: Elasticsearch ★ and ClickHouse ★

**Files:** `connectors/registry/{elasticsearch,clickhouse}.yaml`, `deploy/fabric/connectors/iggy/{elasticsearch_sink,elasticsearch_source,clickhouse_sink}.toml.tmpl`, `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/connectors/clickhouse.rs` (source only), tests, docs.

**Semantics:** Elasticsearch through Iggy's `elasticsearch_sink` and `elasticsearch_source` (configs rendered by `IggyRuntime`), checked against both OpenSearch and Loams’ own ES gateway (`loams dev`), so a route into "Elasticsearch" can target a Loams collection unchanged. ClickHouse sink through Iggy's `clickhouse_sink`; native ClickHouse source over HTTP with the `clickhouse` crate, `SELECT … FORMAT ArrowStream` in key-range partitions, incremental by a cursor column; tested against the FL2 reference server and against Loams House when FL2 has merged.

**Tests:** `es_sink_to_opensearch_and_loams`; `es_source_scroll_resumes`; `clickhouse_sink_batches`; `clickhouse_source_arrow_partitions`; `clickhouse_source_against_house` (skipped until FL2); contract suites.

**Commit:** `connectors: Elasticsearch and ClickHouse through Iggy plugins and a native ClickHouse source`.

### Task 11: ADBC ★, Snowflake ★ and BigQuery ★

**Files:** `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/connectors/adbc.rs`, `connectors/registry/{adbc,snowflake,bigquery}.yaml`, `deploy/fabric/adbc/drivers.toml` (names, versions, URLs, SHA-256), tests, docs.

**Semantics:** `adbc_driver_manager` loads an allowed driver (Ruling 9); **source**: `AdbcStatement::execute` → Arrow stream, split by `partitions` where the driver supports `ExecutePartitions` (Snowflake and BigQuery do, verify), else by key ranges; each batch an Arrow event (Ruling 3). **sink**: `bulk_ingest` (`adbc.ingest.target_table`, mode `append` or `create_append`) per Arrow batch, or staged `MERGE` for upserts where the driver supports it (Snowflake `MERGE` through a temporary table; BigQuery through the Storage Write API's default stream plus `MERGE`, verify). The précis' warehouse → Elasticsearch example ships as a route template: ADBC source with a projecting `SELECT` of the profile fields, ES sink.

**Tests:** `adbc_sqlite_and_duckdb_roundtrip` (local drivers, always run); `adbc_postgres_bulk_ingest`; `snowflake_fixture_replay` and `bigquery_fixture_replay` (recorded HTTP fixtures; real accounts nightly when `LOAMS_SNOWFLAKE_*`/`LOAMS_BIGQUERY_*` are set); `driver_outside_allowlist_is_refused`; `driver_checksum_mismatch_is_refused`; `bulk_path_has_no_row_decode`; `ten_million_rows_within_budget` (Postgres via ADBC into a Fluss Log table; the budget from Task 0); contract suites.

**Commit:** `connectors: ADBC bulk paths for Snowflake, BigQuery and other drivers`.

### Task 12: JDBC ★ through `loams-connect`

**Files:** `connect/**` (YAML route templates, `application.properties`, a compose fragment; no Java), `connectors/registry/jdbc.yaml`, `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/runtime/camel.rs`, `.github/workflows/fabric.yml` (job `connect-routes`, path-filtered on `connect/**`), tests, docs.

**Semantics:** `loams-connect` is the unmodified Camel 4.22.x runtime (Camel JBang or the official image, Ruling 7: Camel Main mode) with `camel-iggy`, `camel-jdbc`, `camel-sql`, `camel-yaml-dsl`, `camel-cloudevents` and the `jq` language on its classpath, loading YAML routes from `/etc/loams-connect/routes/` with route reloading. **Loams writes no Java** (owner, 2026-10-01). JDBC source route: `timer` → `sql` with a high-water query (the high-water value kept in a Camel `caffeine` or file-backed idempotent repository, verify which survives restarts) → a `jq` transform producing the CloudEvents structured JSON (`type` `io.loams.dev.flow.jdbc.rows.v1`, `id` from the table and key) → `iggy:` producer with the `ce_` headers set by `setHeader` steps. JDBC sink route: `iggy:` consumer → `jq` to row maps → `sql` producer with batch inserts. Drivers mounted (Ruling 8). `CamelRuntime` renders the YAML from `connect/routes/templates/` and checks route status over Camel's health endpoint (verify Camel Main's HTTP health in 4.22). If a capability turns out to need Java (for example exact CloudEvents binary-mode headers), the connector declares the narrower capability and the gap is recorded for when Java is un-deferred.

**Tests:** `jdbc_source_postgres_high_water`; `jdbc_sink_batches`; `route_reload_without_restart`; `camel_iggy_roundtrip` (events written by Camel read back by `loams-fabric` with valid envelopes); `rendered_routes_are_valid_yaml_dsl` (Camel's `camel validate`/JBang check, verify the command); contract suite.

**Commit:** `connect: add loams-connect routes (Camel, YAML only) and the JDBC connector`.

### Task 13: Kinesis ★, Redis ★ and OpenTelemetry ★

**Files:** `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/connectors/{kinesis.rs,redis.rs,otlp.rs}`, manifests, tests, docs.

**Semantics:** **Kinesis**: shard iterators with checkpointed sequence numbers per shard (position), resharding followed through parent/child shards, `PutRecords` sink with partial-failure retries; floci in CI. **Redis**: Streams source with `XREADGROUP` in group `loams-<instance>` and `XACK` after the Fabric acknowledges; sinks `XADD`, `SET`/`HSET` by key template, `PUBLISH`; Valkey in CI. **OpenTelemetry**: OTLP/HTTP (`/v1/logs`, `/v1/traces`, `/v1/metrics`, protobuf and JSON) and OTLP/gRPC receivers on `ingest`'s listener under `/v1/namespaces/{ns}/fabric/otlp/{instance}/…` (and a plain `:4318`/`:4317` loopback listener bound to one namespace for collectors that cannot set paths); one CloudEvent per log record, span or data point; `partial_success` for invalid records; OTLP logs meant for search still go to the engine's §02 §7.1 endpoint.

**Tests:** `kinesis_resharding_followed`; `kinesis_put_records_partial_failure`; `redis_streams_group_ack_after_fabric`; `redis_sink_templates`; `otlp_http_and_grpc_each_signal`; `otlp_partial_success`; `kill_restart_*`; contract suites.

**Commit:** `connectors: Kinesis, Redis Streams and OpenTelemetry`.

### Task 14: The CN1 gate, catalog page and exit report

**Files:** `fabric/crates/loams-fabric/tests/e2e.rs` (`cn1_*`), `docs/guides/connectors/index.md` (generated from the registry), `docs/plans/cn1-exit-report.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.

**Semantics:** §33 §9: every ★ manifest validates and passes its suites; the end-to-end CDC test (Postgres → Debezium → `ingest` → Iggy → `fluss_sink` → `orders_current` and `loams_sink` → a Loams collection, with inserts, updates, deletes and a Debezium restart) equals the source; the 10 M-row ADBC test within budget. The catalog page lists all 200 connectors by category with status and runtime, generated by `loams-fabric connectors gen --docs`. The exit report: per connector, throughput and latency measured, duplicate counts in kill tests, gaps found upstream (Iggy plugins, Camel, Debezium) and the issues opened.

**Tests:** `cn1_cdc_end_to_end`; `cn1_adbc_bulk_end_to_end`; `catalog_page_matches_registry`.

**Commit:** `connectors: the CN1 gate, the catalog page and the exit report`.

### Task 15: The collaboration sinks — Zulip ★target, ItsPlane and Forgejo

**Added 2026-10-04** (owner, D628). Not part of the précis' 21, so it is **P1 and unstarred** and does not change D358's ★ count; the catalog goes from 200 rows to 203. It exists because the owner asked for the ability to import data **from Slack, GitHub and Jira into Loams’ own Zulip, ItsPlane and Forgejo**. Slack, GitHub and Jira are already in the registry as P2 Camel connectors (`slack`, `github2`, `jira` — all three confirmed present in Camel 4.22.1), so the missing half was always the three targets.

**Why native and not a runtime:** Camel 4.22.1 has **no component** for Zulip, ItsPlane or Forgejo (verified at tag `camel-4.22.1`: `camel-zulip`, `camel-plane` and `camel-gitea` are all absent), so D354's "buy first" has nothing to buy and all three are `native` Rust in `loams-flow`, speaking each app's public REST API. The OpenAPI generator (Q358's `progenitor`) is CN3's and is not needed here.

**Why nothing changes in `ostrium-labs/loams-plugins`:** that repository states in four places (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/upstreams.md`, `docs/security.md`) that adapters are read-only, its Zulip, Forgejo and ItsPlane adapters issue no mutating request by design, and two of them have tests asserting every request is a `GET`. Its `Forgejo` adapter's own header gives the reason: Forgejo derives the token scope from the HTTP method, so a `GET`-only adapter can never hold a write scope. The write credential therefore lives in Loams’ `SecretStore` (D189) and the target writes happen from the Rust side. **Any later proposal to add a writer inside `loams-plugins` is a policy change for the owner, not an implementation detail** — it would contradict those four statements.

**Licences (D359):** Loams neither ships nor links any of the three, so each is reached over its public HTTP API — D359's carve-out, the same one SaaS services get. ItsPlane's upstream is **AGPL-3.0** and Forgejo's is MIT; `connectors/licences.toml` records both as `kind = "service"` with the reason, so the AGPL id is present as an identifier and never as code or text (`scripts/spec/provenance.sh`).

**Files:** `fabric/crates/loams-flow/src/connectors/{zulip.rs,itsplane.rs,forgejo.rs}`, `connectors/registry/{zulip,itsplane,forgejo}.yaml`, `connectors/schemas/{zulip,itsplane,forgejo}.config.json`, `connect/routes/templates/{zulip,itsplane,forgejo}-import.yaml.tmpl` (the Task 12 YAML-DSL home; no Java), `fabric/crates/loams-flow/tests/{zulip,itsplane,forgejo}.rs`, `docs/guides/connectors/{zulip,itsplane,forgejo}.md`, and the three rows in `connectors/registry/catalog.csv` plus Appendix A.18.

**Semantics.** Each is a `Sink` plus a polling `Source`, at-least-once, with the source's `id` derived from the upstream's own cursor so a re-read is the same event (D355):

- **Zulip** — sink: `POST /api/v1/messages` with the CloudEvents structured payload in the message content, `Idempotency-Key: <ce_id>`, and the connector's **shared 200 requests/60 s** budget — a real upstream limit with no read-only tier, so the sink must self-throttle off `X-RateLimit-Remaining`/`-Reset` and the batcher must be configurable down to a handful of requests per minute. Source: `GET /messages` with `anchor`/`num_after` pagination.
- **ItsPlane** — sink: issue create/update through the app's REST API, keyed on the human `identifier` (`MKT-42`) for idempotence. Source: `GET /projects/{key}/issues`, whose `limit` **truncates silently** with no total and no cursor, so the source must page by its own filter window and record the window, never trust the count. 100 requests/second per API key upstream.
- **Forgejo** — sink: `POST /api/v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` and `.../issues/{index}/comments`. **The token must carry `write:issue` and cannot be the same token as the read scopes**, because Forgejo derives scope from the HTTP method; the config schema therefore has two separate secret names and the manifest documents that one deployment needs two credentials. Source: `GET /repos/{o}/{r}/issues` with `type=issues` and a `since` cursor on `updated_at`, and `limit` clamped to **50** because Forgejo silently clamps a larger value with no error.

**Import routes.** Three templates under `connect/routes/templates/`, each documented in `docs/guides/connectors/` and replayable against fixtures: `github` issues → Forgejo issues and ItsPlane issues; `jira` issues → ItsPlane issues; `slack` messages → Zulip messages (thread-per-channel, `topic` from the Slack thread). Every template declares the projection it needs, because D356's warehouse example applies here too: Slack and GitHub payloads are large and mostly irrelevant to a Zulip message.

**Tests:** `zulip_sink_throttles_to_the_shared_budget`; `zulip_source_anchors_and_resumes`; `itsplane_sink_is_idempotent_on_identifier`; `itsplane_source_pages_by_window_not_by_truncated_limit`; `forgejo_sink_requires_a_separate_write_token` (a config with only the read token is refused with a message naming the missing scope); `forgejo_source_since_cursor_and_limit_clamp`; `no_write_secret_in_a_rendered_config` (extends Task 3's `no_secret_in_rendered_configs_or_logs`); the three `licence_gate` rows; `every_config_ref_resolves`; and the contract suite for each of the three manifests.

**Commit:** `connectors: Zulip, ItsPlane and Forgejo sinks and the import route templates`.

## Rulings made during execution

Rows 1–7 come from Tasks 0–2 (the registry: the schema, the validation, the 200-connector data and the drift checks). Later tasks append their own rows.

| # | Ruling | Why | Cost if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The `fabric/` workspace is created by CN1 Task 1, ahead of FL1 Task 1.** `fabric/Cargo.toml`, `fabric/deny.toml` and `fabric/rust-toolchain.toml` (a symlink to the root's) exist with `[workspace.lints]` copied from the root, because `loams-flow` is a `fabric/` member and the workspace cannot be built without them. FL1 Task 1 finds the workspace in place and adds its own crates | `loams-flow` and `loams-flow-proto` have nowhere else to live (FL1's file structure) | FL1 Task 1 must not re-create them; it adds `loams-fabric-envelope`, `-ingest`, `-testing` and the `lints_match_root` test |
| 2 | **`jsonschema` moves from the Tech Stack's 0.30 to 0.58** (MIT, verified on crates.io 2026-10-04), with `default-features = false` so the HTTP and file resolvers are not linked | 0.30 is 28 releases behind; `validator_for`/`is_valid` are unchanged, and the manifest schema has no external `$ref`, while an instance config's `$ref` is a repository path `loams-flow` resolves itself | None: a manifest-validation library swap is contained in `validate.rs` |
| 3 | **`serde_norway` 0.9.42 (MIT OR Apache-2.0) is the YAML crate**, over unmaintained `serde_yaml` and `serde_yaml_ng` 0.10 | Task 0's "pick a maintained YAML crate" | None |
| 4 | **The Fabric workspace pins `arrow`/`parquet` 59, not 60** (Task 5's formats, Task 11's ADBC). `adbc_core`/`adbc_driver_manager` 0.24 declare `arrow-array >=58, <60`, and arrow 60 is out. The engine workspace stays on 58.4; the two are separate workspaces with separate lockfiles, so there is no conflict | crates.io, 2026-10-04: `parquet`, `arrow-ipc`, `arrow-flight` are all at 60.0.0, and `adbc_core` 0.24's dependency is `>=58, <60`. The Tech Stack's "parquet 59, arrow-ipc/arrow-flight 59" is the only version that satisfies both | The Fluss/Iggy bridge must also pick a version `fluss-rs` accepts; that is FL1's spike to record, and it may force 58.4 across both trees |
| 5 | **A stub manifest's `config.$ref` must resolve too.** `gen_registry.py` writes a placeholder `connectors/schemas/<id>.config.json` for all 179 non-★ rows, and `--check` fails when any manifest's `$ref` does not resolve | The alternative — exempting `status: planned` rows — weakens the check for every future connector, and "every manifest validates" is a Global Constraint | None; 179 small schema files |
| 6 | **`csv_and_manifests_agree` compares identity, not capability cells**: `id`, `name`, `category`, `priority`, `starred`, `status`, `runtime` and `ref`. It does **not** compare `auth` or the capability flags | Ruling 1 says the CSV is "one source for 200 rows; hand-written detail where it matters", and §33 §4 rule 2 makes the manifest authoritative for the runtime Loams ships. The CSV's cells are Appendix A's planning shorthand — kafka's auth cell is `sasl, mtls, iam` while §4's canonical manifest lists the fine-grained `sasl-plain`, `sasl-scram-256`, `sasl-scram-512`, `aws-msk-iam` — so a verbatim comparison would fail on the design doc's own example | If a reviewer wants the cells compared, every ★ manifest's `auth` must be reduced to Appendix A's shorthand, losing `aws-msk-iam` |
| 7 | **A ★ manifest's `streaming` reflects the runtime CN1 ships, not Appendix A's `Y`.** PostgreSQL, MySQL, S3, Iceberg, ClickHouse and JDBC declare `streaming: false`, because their CN1 implementation is a batch or cursor read; the streaming paths are the separate `debezium-*` manifests and Iggy's `postgres_sink`/`clickhouse_sink`, which is what `runtime.ref` names | §33 §4 rule 2 (runtime-specific truth) and CN1 Task 7's `cursor_column` semantics. Appendix A's `Y` covers the Debezium and Iggy alternatives | A route needing Postgres streaming must use the `debezium-postgres` manifest, which is the honest answer |
| 8 | **Ruling 2 gains two event types it does not name**: `io.loams.dev.flow.elasticsearch.document.v1` (one CloudEvent per document from Iggy's `elasticsearch_source`) and `io.loams.dev.flow.clickhouse.rows.v1` (an Arrow batch, the same shape as the Postgres, MySQL and ADBC reads) | Both are ★ sources with no declared type, which would leave `ValidateRoute` unable to match an emitted type. The names follow Ruling 2's own pattern, `io.loams.dev.flow.<connector-id>.<event>.v1` | An event-type rename is a manifest major bump (§33 §4 rule 4) |
| 9 | **`bulk.arrow` is true for parquet, avro and arrow** (and for the sources that read Arrow: ClickHouse), false for Elasticsearch | The flag marks the columnar bulk path (D356), not the wire encoding: `formats::decode` yields a `RecordBatch` stream and Ruling 3 has the batch-of-rows event carry `application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream`. Parquet's and Avro's input encoding stops at the file boundary. Elasticsearch's sink is Iggy's NDJSON bulk API, so it is genuinely not an Arrow path | None: the flag is descriptive, and `bulk_path_has_no_row_decode` (Task 11) is the real gate |
| 10 | **`fabric/proto` is not yet a buf module.** `buf.yaml` declares `modules: - path: proto`, so `buf lint` does not cover `loams.flow.v1` yet; the file is kept STANDARD-clean by inspection, and the wiring lands with CN1 Task 3's `flow.proto` | Adding a second module now would change what the existing `live-protos` and `app-protos` CI jobs lint, with no way to verify the result locally | Nothing; the protos compile and Task 3 closes it |
| 11 | **The catalog is 203 rows, not 200, and ★ stays 21** (D628, Task 15). Zulip, ItsPlane and Forgejo are added as **P1 but unstarred**: they build in CN1, they are not in the précis' 21, and D358's count is untouched. `registry_has_200_entries_and_21_starred` becomes `registry_has_203_entries_and_21_starred` | The owner asked for the import direction on 2026-10-04. A "P1 = ★" reading of Appendix A's legend would have forced either a 24th ★ (contradicting D358) or a P2 row that does not ship in CN1 (contradicting the ask), so the legend is amended to say P1 is CN1 and ★ is the 21 | Nothing structural; the alternative readings both break a stated number |
| 12 | **The third application is ItsPlane, not Plane.** The id is `itsplane`, and `connectors/licences.toml` records its upstream as **AGPL-3.0**, reached over HTTP only | `ostrium-labs/loams-plugins` ships `plugin-itsaplan-adapter`, whose own types call it "a self-hosted issue tracker / project-management tool — Linear/Jira shaped" and record the AGPL-3.0 status with the reason Loams consumes only its HTTP API. plane.so is a different product with no presence in the repository | If the owner meant plane.so, this is a fourth target and CN1 Task 15 grows one row |
| 13 | **Nothing changes in `ostrium-labs/loams-plugins`**, and no connector in CN1 calls it | That repository documents adapters as read-only in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/upstreams.md` and `docs/security.md`, and two adapters have tests asserting every request is a `GET`. It is `private: true` at version `0.0.1`, has never been published and has no tags, so there is no artifact to depend on and no semver to pin | Adding a writer there would need an owner ruling against its own stated policy; a future CN1 connector that *reads* through it must treat it as an optional, version-pinned, best-effort HTTP peer, the same posture CN1 takes toward Camel and Debezium |
