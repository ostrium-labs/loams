"""The P4b merge gate (design §28 §7): Loam WAL vs stock safekeepers.

    compare.py [--name NAME] --baseline sk-a.json sk-b.json sk-c.json --candidate loam.json [...]

For every workload the gate holds when the candidate's mean is inside the
baseline's run-to-run noise band:
  mean p99(candidate) <= max p99 over the baseline repeats, and
  mean tps(candidate) >= min tps over the baseline repeats.
The noise column shows the baseline spread ((max - min) / mean). `bulk`
(a sustained 1 GB write) compares WAL MB/s as throughput and gates.
`bulk-burst` (250 MB, which the drive cache absorbs) is reported but does not
count toward pass or fail. The CPU columns are the WAL tier's CPU time per
transaction (per MB for bulk), from run.sh; they are reported, not gated.
Prints a Markdown table; exits 1 if the gate fails.
