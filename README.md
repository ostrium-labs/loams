![Loams — Your data. Your bucket.](docs/assets/loams-banner.svg)

# Loams

**One bucket, every index: hybrid retrieval on object storage, with reactive data and durable agent runs beside it.**

Loams is an open-source, AI-native data platform built in Rust. It stores retrieval data in *your* object-storage bucket (RustFS, S3, GCS, Azure Blob or a local directory) in open formats: Lance and Tantivy today, Apache Iceberg next. Metadata lives in an embedded Raft metastore or in TiKV, and durable-execution state in SQLite (TiKV support is in progress). Retrieval compute is stateless and holds only caches, so it scales independently and can be replaced at any time.

> **Early and moving fast.** Loams has no stable release yet, and APIs, formats and flags change without notice. The crates are `loams-*` and the binary is `loams`; nothing is published yet. The design is public in [`docs/design`](docs/design/README.md).

## Why Loams

A typical production AI application runs Elasticsearch for keyword search, Qdrant for vectors, Neo4j for the knowledge graph, and Kafka for events, and often a workflow engine for agent runs too. That means four or five stateful clusters, several copies of the same data, connector pipelines between them, and retrieval logic glued together in application code across three network hops.

Loams replaces that stack with one engine on one bucket:

- **Object storage is the source of truth for data.** Documents, vectors, text indexes and the log live in open formats in your bucket. You pay object-storage prices, with no 3× block-storage replication, and losing a query node loses no data. Only the small metadata and transaction state lives elsewhere: in the embedded metastore or in TiKV.
- **The log is the spine.** Every write, whether native, Qdrant, Elasticsearch or Flight SQL, lands in a log first. Collections are materializations of that log, maintained by declarative *links*, so there is no connector zoo. Every write returns a **consistency token** that any later read can use to see it.
- **Hybrid retrieval as one planned query.** Dense vectors, BM25 full text and filters, fused with reciprocal rank fusion in one DataFusion plan. Graph expansion for GraphRAG is next.
- **Hot tiers where it matters.** Node-local, rebuildable acceleration in RAM and NVMe: HNSW graphs for vectors and pinned Tantivy splits for text, over a cheap durable tier on the bucket.
- **Drop-in where it helps adoption.** Existing Qdrant and Elasticsearch clients, and the LangChain and LlamaIndex integrations built on them, work unmodified against the subset Loams implements.
- **More than retrieval.** *Loams Live* is a reactive document database on TiKV. *Loams Durable* embeds a [Resonate](https://github.com/resonatehq/resonate) server, so agent runs survive crashes without repeating model calls.

Read the [pitch](docs/design/00-pitch.md) and the [architecture](docs/design/01-architecture.md) for the full reasoning.

## Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/architecture.svg" alt="Loams architecture. Clients and protocols reach a stateless gateway and router. Behind it sit the retrieval engine, Loams Live, Loams Durable, the runtime and jobs, and Loams Postgres. TiKV holds metadata, transactions and the hot WAL. Object storage holds all data in open formats. Dotted outlines are in progress; dashed outlines are planned." width="100%">
</p>

- **Clients and protocols.** The native REST API, Arrow Flight SQL, and the Qdrant and Elasticsearch APIs, with Postgres and Kafka wire protocols to come.
- **Gateway and router.** A stateless layer that speaks every protocol, issues consistency tokens and routes each request to the node that owns the data.
- **Compute.** The retrieval engine, which covers the log, links, collections, the query engine, the hot tier and background workers. Beside it run Loams Live, Loams Durable and, later, a CPU-time functions runtime, jobs and Loams Postgres.
- **TiKV.** Metadata (the catalog, leases and the timestamp oracle), Live's transactions, and a hot WAL. Single-node deployments use an embedded Raft metastore instead.
- **Object storage.** Log segments, Lance datasets, Tantivy splits, manifests and hot-tier artifacts. Iceberg tables and Postgres pages come later.

## Monorepo applications

This repository also contains [Loams Desktop](apps/desktop-electron/README.md) with its agent daemon ([`crates/loams-agentd`](docs/design/50-loams-desktop-daemon.md)),
[native Android/iOS apps](apps/mobile/README.md), and [plugin services and dashboard](plugins/README.md).
Nx coordinates Cargo, Gradle, Xcode/SwiftPM, Go, and the root pnpm workspace; it does not replace those build tools.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm projects
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

The default JavaScript checks do not require native toolchains. Build native apps separately with
`pnpm build:desktop`, `pnpm build:android`, or `pnpm build:ios` on a supported host.
See [the monorepo guide](docs/monorepo.md) for prerequisites, commands, migration provenance,
contract ownership, and current validation limits. Scoped licenses remain beside imported components.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- **Rust.** Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs); the toolchain pinned in [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml) installs on first build.
- **protoc**, the Protocol Buffers compiler: `apt install protobuf-compiler`, `brew install protobuf`, or `pacman -S protobuf`.
- **Memory.** The first build compiles DataFusion, Lance and Tantivy, so it is heavy. On machines with less than 32 GB of RAM, limit parallel jobs with `-j 4`.

On **Windows** and **macOS** there are extra prerequisites — the MSVC Build Tools and NASM on Windows — and there are no binaries to download. See [`docs/build-from-source/`](docs/build-from-source/README.md).

### Run a dev server

`loams dev` runs everything in one process, with data in a local directory (`.loams/` by default):

```sh
cargo run --release -p loams -- dev
```

It serves these listeners, each of which you can move or turn off (`loams dev --help`):

| Surface | Default address | Flag |
|---|---|---|
| Native HTTP API | `127.0.0.1:8080` | `--listen` |
| Arrow Flight SQL | `127.0.0.1:8082` | `--flight-sql-listen`, `--no-flight-sql` |
| Qdrant REST and gRPC | `127.0.0.1:6333`, `127.0.0.1:6334` | `--qdrant-listen`, `--qdrant-grpc-listen`, `--no-qdrant` |
| Elasticsearch REST | `127.0.0.1:9200` | `--es-listen`, `--no-es` |
| Resonate (with `--features durable`) | `127.0.0.1:8001` | `--durable-listen`, `--no-durable` |

To run against a bucket instead of a local directory, use `loams standalone --bucket s3://bucket/prefix`. For a multi-node deployment, use `loams cluster`.

### Hybrid search with the native API

Create a collection, write documents and run a hybrid query. Every write returns a consistency token, and reads are strong by default, so they see the write at once.

```sh
curl -s localhost:8080/v1/namespaces/demo/collections -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "name": "kb",
  "schema": {
    "fields": [
      {"name": "body", "source_path": "body", "kind": {"text": {"analyzer": "standard", "positions": true}}, "indexed": true, "fast": false},
      {"name": "tenant", "source_path": "tenant", "kind": "keyword", "indexed": true, "fast": true}
    ],
    "vectors": [{"name": "embedding", "dim": 3, "distance": "cosine"}],
    "sparse_vectors": [], "dynamic": "ignore", "max_fields": 1000
  }
}'

curl -s localhost:8080/v1/namespaces/demo/collections/kb/documents -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"ops": [
  {"upsert": {"id": 1, "source": {"body": "refund policy", "tenant": "a"}, "vectors": {"embedding": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]}}},
  {"upsert": {"id": 2, "source": {"body": "shipping times", "tenant": "a"}, "vectors": {"embedding": [0.9, 0.1, 0.0]}}},
  {"upsert": {"id": 3, "source": {"body": "refund window", "tenant": "b"}, "vectors": {"embedding": [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]}}}
]}'

curl -s localhost:8080/v1/namespaces/demo/query -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "from": "collections.kb",
  "retrieve": [
    {"vector": {"field": "embedding", "query": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], "k": 10}},
    {"text": {"field": "body", "query": "refund", "k": 10}}
  ],
  "filter": {"term": {"tenant": "a"}},
  "fuse": {"method": "rrf", "k": 60},
  "limit": 3
}'
```

The same query in SQL:

```sh
curl -s localhost:8080/v1/namespaces/demo/sql -H 'content-type: application/json' -d @- <<'JSON'
{"query": "SELECT _id, body, _score FROM rrf(vector_search('kb', [1.0, 0.0, 0.0], 'embedding', 10), text_search('kb', 'refund', 'body', 10)) LIMIT 3"}
JSON
```

### Use an existing Qdrant client

```python
# pip install qdrant-client
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

client = QdrantClient(url="http://localhost:6333")
client.create_collection("docs", vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=3, distance=models.Distance.COSINE))
client.upsert("docs", points=[models.PointStruct(id=1, vector=[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], payload={"title": "refunds"})], wait=True)
print(client.query_points("docs", query=[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], limit=1))
```

Requests without a `Loams-Namespace` header go to the `default` namespace. The Elasticsearch API on port 9200 works the same way with `elasticsearch-py`.

### Query over Flight SQL

```python
# pip install adbc-driver-flightsql pyarrow
import adbc_driver_flightsql.dbapi as flight_sql

with flight_sql.connect(
    "grpc://127.0.0.1:8082",
    db_kwargs={"adbc.flight.sql.rpc.call_header.loams-namespace": "demo"},
) as conn, conn.cursor() as cur:
    cur.execute("SELECT _id, body FROM kb ORDER BY _id")
    print(cur.fetch_arrow_table())
```

### Read the bucket directly

`POST /v1/namespaces/{ns}/collections/{c}/scan` returns a pinned Lance version, which pylance reads straight from the bucket (`pip install pylance==12.0.0`):

```python
import json, urllib.request
import lance

request = urllib.request.Request(
    "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/namespaces/demo/collections/kb/scan",
    data=b"{}", headers={"content-type": "application/json"},
)
plan = json.load(urllib.request.urlopen(request))
if plan["lance"] is not None:  # null until the first commit
    dataset = lance.dataset(plan["lance"]["uri"], version=plan["lance"]["version"])
    print(dataset.count_rows(), "live documents; tail:", plan["tail_records"], "records")
```

Writes that the pinned version does not hold yet (the plan's *tail*) are readable through the native API or Flight SQL.

## Roadmap

In order: hybrid retrieval hardened for production (auth, quotas, telemetry, multi-node clusters, the Kubernetes operator), then graph expansion, streams with Kafka compatibility, and Iceberg analytics. Loams Live, Loams Durable, the functions runtime, jobs and Loams Postgres advance on their own tracks. The details, with exit criteria for each stage, are in [the roadmap](docs/design/12-roadmap-testing-risks.md) and [the implementation plans](docs/plans/README.md). Architectural decisions are recorded in [the decision log](docs/design/13-decision-log.md).
